This is due by Friday, a weekly challenge podcast with really man, Alex Cox and Max tempted. This week's challenge. Bring the funny.

Unknown 0:19
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Oh, hello, hello, on yo. Hi.

Unknown 0:28
I have a grievance guess to err on the podcast UU.

Unknown 0:32
Yeah, I have a number of grievances.

Unknown 0:37
It's kind of weird.

Unknown 0:38
So remember, I got hit by a car A while back. And I decided to go on the journey of buying a helmet. And so I went online and I looked up. And I went online and I looked up,

Unknown 0:48
looked up at sitting all over again.

Unknown 0:53
And I looked up what the best helmets are. And I found one that was was getting a lot of attention. And I think it's a Danish, and it's called The Hunger Games. It's basically an airbag. And it's basically an airbag that goes around your neck or

Unknown 1:05
so

Unknown 1:07
it goes around your neck, and it inflates. When you get into an impact goes, what it's it's a neck airbag, so it looks like a scarf and you move it around your neck. And at the moment of impact or impact or where you lose equilibrium. It has sense you have to charge it

Unknown 1:22
is this really looks like

Unknown 1:24
yes, when it's inflated.

Unknown 1:27
And it's like you should go on YouTube and look at it because it's sure well, it's amazed like watching it in action is amazing. And I thought well that's I thought this is a helmet that I could tolerate because it doesn't obstruct your field

Unknown 1:40
of vision when you're on a skateboard and this thing inflates you're going to look so cool KB vaping when it happens,

Unknown 1:46
listen, I don't care if I look cool. When I get struck by a car at that point you already don't look cool. I just want to avoid any brain damage. It's all the moments when I'm not being hit by a car when

Unknown 1:56
one of your team friends BB shooting it for your YouTube channel.

Unknown 2:00
But it all the moments when you're not being hit by a car just looks like a scarf which is which is fine. Okay,

Unknown 2:05
yeah.

Unknown 2:06
No, it looks real bad. It looks really stupid.

Unknown 2:10
No, it looks good. No,

Unknown 2:12
I would keep it this way all the time. Just be like fuck y'all, man. I haven't I haven't inflate a hood. It looks cool.

Unknown 2:18
And it's not inflated.

Unknown 2:19
Well, I think people just you need to wear it all the time. So people think you're like an iron neck man. Because otherwise they're gonna know you guys

Unknown 2:27
are laughing You know, first they ignore you. First they ignore you. And then they make fun of you.

Unknown 2:33
I want you to be safe, be safe,

Unknown 2:35
and then they accept you you guys are all going to be wearing have days and a few years.

Unknown 2:40
So anyways, beautiful and she looks insane.

Unknown 2:43
Look at this. It's like a little neck brace. It's like a little scarf charging

Unknown 2:46
you to charge it. Oh, because

Unknown 2:49
that's what I do. Every time I get on a bike or charge my charger,

Unknown 2:54
charger scarf color and cover.

Unknown 2:56
I already tried the helmet that I had you have to charge but anyway,

Unknown 2:59
do you have to charge it like once a month for the light to charge it? See? No no, no, no, no, no this thing you have to charge like every day,

Unknown 3:06
you charge it once a month. Anyway, so I really want them one. And I think it's really cool technology and it is used in in Europe

Unknown 3:15
was praised in a study at Stanford University.

Unknown 3:19
It is used in Europe and I and here's the thing I would wear I'm not going to wear an eye In fact, I own a really nice helmet now and I don't wear it most of the time. But this I would wear I could really see myself wearing more often. So anyway, you can order it in the United States. I don't know why I assume we have some sort of regulatory environment that doesn't allow this thing to be sold. And so I am so I was started thinking like who could go who could buy this thing for me. And my dear friend Mike Hurley was like I will get this thing and get it for you. So he had to what he had to already jump through some hoops just to get it in, in in the UK. Mm hmm. And I think he had to order through some like weird website where you know, third party thing where they ship it to you had to pay in the theorem. Did he? I don't know.

Unknown 4:03
It's technically ammunition

Unknown 4:04
it's not cheap. It's $350 it's it's less than euros but when dollars is 350

Unknown 4:09
and wait does it only works once right it's like an Arab

Unknown 4:13
every home it only works one.

Unknown 4:15
Okay, fair.

Unknown 4:18
That's what happened to Kramer that's why crazy Joe de bola crazy. Joe Davila kicked him in the head yet a different OA traded it to Newman if memory serves.

Unknown 4:26
We're supposed to throw every helmet out get into one impact with that throw every helmet out. So there's no such thing as a reusable helmets like milk. So Mike shipped to me the the hub Dang. And it was destroyed by customs officials. They were they sent me a note saying we've destroyed this property. So I didn't receive it. I assume that means it's not legal for me to have in the United States. Or it would have exploded in transit or something.

Unknown 4:52
And oh, that's that's why I just want

Unknown 4:54
to pay Mike the $350 for the helmet. I really appreciate that. He went to the effort. It's not his fault. It's didn't clear my illegal helmet. didn't clear customs.

Unknown 5:03
A quick quick question. Did you mention it to him more than once?

Unknown 5:06
I have asked him 50 times it is you It's driving me insane.

Unknown 5:11
Max. Max, what was his response? When you said you want to paint what he

Unknown 5:13
was like? Just buy me a drink or so what did he say?

Unknown 5:16
He said by let's go out for a nice dinner the next time he's in Chicago,

Unknown 5:20
that's completely unacceptable. The nice dinner would cover the time that he put into this project, but not that money, you should go to a place

Unknown 5:26
where the aviary push with a spin on Eric Trump.

Unknown 5:32
Anyway, listen, we need to get some sort of peer pressure campaign or something. Maybe I'll buy some of those like Instagram, those ads that we found in that company that will do a custom advertising campaign. And I'll just have a target Mike. You know what you put on one of your 14 to do lists. Except $350

Unknown 5:52
you should buy a more check marks you can put on his phone with stickers.

Unknown 5:55
He's fucking bulletproof because I keep trying to like I tried to like Apple Pay

Unknown 5:58
his wily. That guy's wireless.

Unknown 6:00
Yeah, I tried to like Apple cash in the $350 and he's like oh doesn't work I'm in England.

Unknown 6:05
We wait why don't we buy we I mean you buy a sponsor Relay for like, just one show by one hand that's probably an Irish of time Let's

Unknown 6:17
wait a minute wait a minute you saying we do it on our program whether he wants it or not?

Unknown 6:21
The No no, no, no.

Unknown 6:23
Why don't we doing ads and what we weren't charged now. He's gonna owe us money.

Unknown 6:32
good ideas

Unknown 6:33
are now governor.

Unknown 6:35
Okay. All right. All right. Let's a lot of good ideas up up in the air. Now let me let me What if I sponsor one of my programs and the sponsor message is an apology note to me where he apologizes for not accepting $50

Unknown 6:50
that would hold up in a court. Yeah, I gotta

Unknown 6:52
do it.

Unknown 6:53
What programs what what's the best one to do it?

Unknown 6:56
I mean, I would say look, huh? What if it's wrecked it? Oh, no. Mike has to snow. It's got

Unknown 7:02
a minute Mike to read. Uh

Unknown 7:04
huh. I'm trying to such a good idea and where he does all of the spots and I can't think of one where he well I

Unknown 7:10
can probably specify I'm gonna add purchase or I can probably specify

Unknown 7:13
That's true. That's true. Uh, I would, I would say either upgrader cortex cortex would be funnier because no one would have any idea what was going on. I know

Unknown 7:24
I don't want those people to get mad at me. I'm just gonna have to upgrade

Unknown 7:27
Oh, that's so

Unknown 7:29
Oh, that's good too because it gets us in as an early bid to win an upgrade he

Unknown 7:33
can it can make a small request I'm not married this is your project but Mike writes all the ad copy that I have to read and he writes it as an English person and I have to translate it on the fly. And so he says things like when he first to accompany he refers to it as a plural rather than a singular and I have to like it drives me bananas. Merlin

Unknown 7:54
is on male pattern baldness getting your knickers in a lorry

Unknown 8:00
try putting your trousers in the boot

Unknown 8:04
I was saying is I want to write some I want to assist I want an edit on whatever you write that makes it ridiculously American English and I think we should also request that he effect should

Unknown 8:15
definitely begin with Howdy

Unknown 8:17
Howdy folks. I think if you pay more

Unknown 8:21
you should have to do it in an American accent and he has to try to actually fucking try

Unknown 8:26
if Casper can hold hosts hostage because they said latex This is a reasonable risk

Unknown 8:32
it's got red letters you got to do it if we put it in red letters he has to do it or to make good in any Can I

Unknown 8:40
specify that he has to use profanity 30 seconds before in 30 seconds

Unknown 8:59
This is a great day

Unknown 9:01
oh you're

Unknown 9:02
gonna be so fucking rich. He's gonna learn he fucked with the wrong guy. He holding the wrong fella. Yeah,

Unknown 9:07
strap on your have dang Mike I'm coming for you

Unknown 9:13
that had that ad reads that ad thing and his his helmets going to inflate.

Unknown 9:19
You know, it's so it's so easy to write. And it's very difficult to say things out loud. I'm going to twist that guy's tongue and do some fucking knicker wads. Oh my god, it's going to be so hard to read.

Unknown 9:32
Ah,

Unknown 9:33
I just Fanny's apology is available in in two different colors. red leather, yellow leather.

Unknown 9:39
red leather, yellow leather,

Unknown 9:40
red leather yellow leather. Spencer Bledsoe, the 66

Unknown 9:45
long Asian boy.

Unknown 9:46
Oh,

Unknown 9:50
let's see I have I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You had to go through this. This is terrible. Next.

Unknown 9:55
I have a good amount of follow up. Would you want to talk about Eric Trump getting spit on real quick? No,

Unknown 9:59
no good. Was your follow up?

Unknown 10:00
No, that's it. That's my follow up. No, no, I just think it's funny. He went to a bar in Chicago. Have you been there to aviary next I Twitter is very, very upset about

Unknown 10:09
a beer at the bar. Yeah,

Unknown 10:10
yeah, Alex, I have both been to this bar. It's a very fancy cocktail bar in Chicago. And in fact, the owner Nick was on our program, our top scallops, restaurant wars. And I think Nick was like on a flight when this all went down last night, which was my worst nightmare that there's some sort of like PR disaster that happens for cards and you know, I'm, I'm on. I'm on an airplane and I can't do anything. But I it was on Twitter last night that Eric Trump went into this very fancy bar aviary where it's very sort of molecular gastronomy sort of inventive, like foam drinks. I'm like, the one that that always stands out in my mind is you get an old fat pretty classic, old fashioned, but it's frozen. It's not frozen. It's it's liquid. It's a it's a liquid old fashioned cocktail. And it's inside of a spherical ice cube. So you have a spherical shell of ice. And that was a perfect old fashioned inside of it. And then they they bounced the ice on a glass and they have this like, slingshot contraption. And you pull back and you fire it and it smashes the ice and the whole thing explodes into like, like a cloud. And the cocktail comes crashing into the glass. It's It's incredible.

Unknown 11:17
It looks like the fanciest vape in the world.

Unknown 11:20
Every every person who orders that has to work in a soup kitchen for a week.

Unknown 11:24
Well, my slingshot was with

Unknown 11:28
two stars.

Unknown 11:30
Stars. I didn't get spit on so

Unknown 11:34
so I guess Eric Trump Yeah, he went there last night. One of the one of the front of house people spit on him, which is which is really exciting. I kudos to that guy.

Unknown 11:43
I remember going away. This is the whole story. There's no way.

Unknown 11:46
Why if I listen, if I if Eric Trump using

Unknown 11:49
Nick what using Nick would hire somebody who spits on a customer?

Unknown 11:53
On Eric Trump? Yeah, yeah, I actually 100%

Unknown 11:56
would believe that. I don't know about the I don't know. But I think Nick would,

Unknown 12:01
isn't it like a dream job to work at a place like that?

Unknown 12:05
But probably not as big of a dream spitting on air?

Unknown 12:09
I mean, you know, but listen, all I want to say is, first of all, I strongly agree with spitting on fascists, these people have they have they, they're the ones who have broken the social contract. And they should be given no quarter in civilian life, they should never be able to walk into a bar or get into a taxi or go anywhere. Without people being mad at them and shaming them and spitting in their face and maybe stop short of doing physical violence to them. I guess. You'll have to figure that out for yourself. I'd be

Unknown 12:37
so sad. If somebody spent on me,

Unknown 12:39
it would be very upsetting, but also like, you're not putting children in in concentration camps. So

Unknown 12:44
you don't know that. You don't know that.

Unknown 12:46
But I think I was thinking about this. And like if there was like a cards employee who spit if you know if Eric Trump came to one of our comedy shows, I mean, the first thing is we wouldn't do the show. we'd send everyone we'd say we would rather disappoint everybody then give one moment of laughter to Eric Trump.

Unknown 13:00
Oh, no, we would i don't think i think you would do is

Unknown 13:03
make fun of his gums on

Unknown 13:04
a show. But like, just no I,

Unknown 13:07
I would come out and i would i would say go fuck yourself. You've ruined the show for everybody.

Unknown 13:11
That's the show. You're not welcome. That's the show.

Unknown 13:13
I would furthermore if we if you didn't come to one of our events, and I had an employee, you spotted him and didn't spit on him. I'd be very mad at that employee. You would have an expectation at this company.

Unknown 13:22
We tell people for far less.

Unknown 13:25
Yeah, you have to spit on Eric Trump. If you see him, it's Christ. It's the only civil like, like I will get into this fucking pretzel pretzel ethical logic in a minute because I have a really I have a really good one of my follow up notes. But like, if you're living in some sort of fucking worldview, where you owe some sort of deference to these people by not spitting on them in public is

Unknown 13:44
me me for this one. I am who can't believe this. I completely agree with Max. Yep. Uh huh. I know. It's a tweet at me. Don't tweet it. Merlin. It's fine. It's fine. Which

Unknown 13:56
I also think that game you know that game that you play like, guys will play with each other where they just sort of swiftly do like one tap on the nuts and then run away. Oh, docking.

Unknown 14:08
Oh, called tap

Unknown 14:10
tap? Is it called tapping? Is that what's called? Yeah, it looks somebody on the penis. Yeah, just in a knot gateway.

Unknown 14:16
Yeah, it's okay. No, no, but I do think that that's also permitted I think such

Unknown 14:21
a dick because I'm competitive.

Unknown 14:23
I know. I can keep like, one swift one SWAT to the nuts and then you were

Unknown 14:29
gummy smile. Yeah.

Unknown 14:33
My father is the most prolific topper in New York City.

Unknown 14:41
My father discovered ice in 1967.

Unknown 14:51
Alright, and then what else? I have a bunch of concentration camp fall off. And then I don't know. I'm trying to figure out what's going to be less depressing to talk about first. He asked do you want to talk?

Unknown 15:01
Alex Welcome Welcome back. Alex. We missed you your unexplained absence. The episode

Unknown 15:06
was so bad

Unknown 15:07
Alex says everybody said the show's not the same without you. We knew it while we're doing it and I think it's a testament to how beloved you are that so many people said yes. That's what you shut your mouth.

Unknown 15:17
We can't talk about spitting on Eric Trump but you can say this to me mm hmm

Unknown 15:28
that's gonna that's gonna fix a lot of shit

Unknown 15:35
was too hard

Unknown 15:41
cuz I'm competitive

Unknown 15:44
that's what my pants

Unknown 15:47
suit area this man

Unknown 15:54
fuck is wrong with men?

Unknown 15:55
Oh, it

Unknown 15:56
was a big thick looky

Unknown 16:00
I hope it was this guess I hope it was a good one he was the

Unknown 16:03
day you that one day you forgot the clear the

Unknown 16:05
one thing is like you know in this movie when they when you're being like you're like tied down and you're being interrogated and the guys like Tell me now or I'll kill you and then you spit on his face. I

Unknown 16:13
watch those movies all the time. Yeah,

Unknown 16:15
like like you know when when you supposed to spit in the right in the guy's face. I don't think under that kind of pressure. I'd be able to produce a good spit

Unknown 16:24
yet dry mouth. Yeah,

Unknown 16:25
that's well actually that's why I think it would have been a great Luke eight because if you're working at like the aviary, Alinea wherever and it's like crazy White Glove service you your your your anus is clenched. Your mouth is completely shut unless you need to talk. So there's got to be like build up, you know? And like you're not going to be sniffing so there's a lot of stuff to work with there. Yeah, I agree.

Unknown 16:49
Oh, I know what I wanted to say. If anyone knows who the guy is just reach get met. Tell me privately if there's like a bail fund or legal defense fund or something because I would gladly continue to there's any

Unknown 16:58
chance that like he accidentally, like he said he sprayed it instead of saying you

Unknown 17:04
know he walked up to the man and spit spit in his face which is awesome.

Unknown 17:08
He spit in his in his Eric Trump gummy face.

Unknown 17:10
Yeah, it's awesome. And also if you if you do wind up getting fired, come talk to me will will will hire that's,

Unknown 17:16
you know, that's kind of thing my father says.

Unknown 17:18
That's good. Moral. It's good. It's good moral

Unknown 17:20
character. If you go and spit in any of the people, I will pay your bills. What am I six coats that I'm wearing?

Unknown 17:28
Oh, that should be part of the interview process. For car would you would you spit in or no,

Unknown 17:33
no, no, no, you were allowed to ask that.

Unknown 17:35
No, exactly. No, no, no. You just put a fascist in the room like we set a fascist trap. Get him

Unknown 17:41
in the room. He gets in the X and net false. Yes, yes.

Unknown 17:43
And then once he starts talking if if the potential employee spits in the face, it's just another thing to add on to the resume.

Unknown 17:51
Try this with Jen CF. Jen, what's been on a fascist?

Unknown 17:56
Yeah, I know.

Unknown 17:59
Jen, would you we'll do a SWOT and spit Yeah,

Unknown 18:01
there's there's she would set her dog on tap in which you tap in first throw him off his game now. Now you thrown him off his rhythm. Jen.

Unknown 18:08
Jen is almost spit in my face over comma placement. Yeah.

Unknown 18:26
Oh, let's let's quickly talk about where I was last week, just so people missed you for sending me wishes and stuff. But I plan to be on the show last week. And I was just doing a routine checkup for something I've addressed on the show before the tiny bump on my hand that doesn't let me do magic tricks anymore. Um, and they were like, does Does this hurt as they're poking at it and they did a small biopsy like one of those really small biopsies where you just, they don't even cut it open. They just put a needle straight in and like suck it out. Like there's not even a mark anymore. And I was like, I mean, little bit and then Okay, we'll give you a prescription for Vicodin and like, Um, no, no one not even your hands has such small biopsies the the weight the little you've never had like a little biopsy.

Unknown 19:13
I don't go to the doctor. But the second needle they put in

Unknown 19:16
Yeah, it's well, it's it's a pretty big needle like a

Unknown 19:21
needle coming into my hand.

Unknown 19:22
Yeah, who who doesn't have a needle?

Unknown 19:26
If you don't like that you're a fascist.

Unknown 19:28
Oh, boy.

Unknown 19:31
And I'm like, Can I can I just have something other than

Unknown 19:36
a regular prescription? It was an in office thing that went? Got all

Unknown 19:40
yeah. So I was in there. And because like, you know, you know, my brain bits are broken. So I'm on stuff and like, I just don't want to mix that and they're like, All right, we'll give you a shot of a trip trip. It'll trip. I can't say it. It's the stuff that basically they have to shoot not in your butt, but on your butt. So I wasn't thrilled with that. But I'm a like, okay, it's basically really strong ibuprofen. Turns out allergic to that.

Unknown 20:06
So that's why I wasn't on the show.

Unknown 20:08
You had a reaction in the office.

Unknown 20:10
Oh, yeah. I don't remember anything. All I don't remember telling me it detects you guys. I don't I don't remember it. Like I mean, I was crying when I woke up because they just gave me like

Unknown 20:22
Maddie didn't text us. We texted you and then that she responded. Oh, okay. Yes, yes. You're like, yo, hey, what's up? Everything good. He's still coming. Of course, I assure I assured max that I think what I said was I'm sure she I'm sure she's fine.

Unknown 20:36
She's blind on the side of the highway. In a gutter.

Unknown 20:40
Oh, well, the first thing I did when I woke up was indeed like, Oh shit, I'm going to be late for do by Friday. Nope. But the number of people reached out thank you very much. I'll be all right. And but there was there was the late conspiracies going around. I got someone to take it down on Reddit. But people were like, Did something happen between like you and Merlin and Max? And I?

Unknown 21:05
And, and I was like, No, no, no, I like I was here something No, no, I just

Unknown 21:13
wait

Unknown 21:14
on your nose. I was just a Reddit post this this people reach out to me privately and it goes well, if you remember their use and

Unknown 21:24
this is my favorite Reddit post of all that has been on our Reddit of all time, which is why is Alex on a fuck you basis with Casey lists? And then there was it all this speculation and this was

Unknown 21:37
other I know it's it's a disaster. And he texted sexual tension. It's just

Unknown 21:42
oh my god. It's more if if Alex and Casey get in the same room.

Unknown 21:48

Unknown 21:57
And I said Merlin Merlin I apologize. And then I said I didn't epic blow out. No, I said I had an epic blow a fight with Merlin. The show is over. And I thought by saying blow away. Oh, thanks

Unknown 22:08

Unknown 22:11
Well, because ever because he assumed it would be max. And I'm like, you don't think I could take that? Come on now. Come on. He's like, Wait, what? How? And I took a really long time to respond because my hand is still a little messed up and I type real real slow and he just proceed to be like, Hey, is everything okay? What's going on? How can I help?

Unknown 26:38
One time someone tried to tap my father at a museum and now they're in jail.

Unknown 26:58
I want to hear about it the camps where the children have concentrated.

Unknown 27:02
Well, I do have a comedy Believe it or not. I do have a sort of a comedy angle on this. But I thought that I would first before we get into the funny parts about the children concentration camps. I did want to just mention because we were rolling. I were really despairing about it last week, and I did listen back to the episode. It was not a good episode. No, I disagree. Well, maybe it's because I was sad. It was a very bad episode. And then I thought I was like, then you guys made me sad was perfect. I listened back to it. And I felt that one of the services that we did was we were really despairing and navel gazing and talking about how upsetting it was to have concentration camps happening to other people. But we did not really

Unknown 27:36
deserve Go Fund Me we should go to or something. No, we

Unknown 27:39
just didn't get into that any actual, like factual content about what's going on with them.

Unknown 27:42
So we're gonna do that during

Unknown 27:44
I just got a couple of quotes from a few different articles. And I thought it would be it would be useful to talk about it just so people know what the hell we're talking about. I sadly have had many people tell me that this is one of the primary places where they get their news. You guys

Unknown 27:58
heard that? Oh, all the time. I don't. I don't blame folks who are like international like,

Unknown 28:04
Okay, listen, I'm speaking to you the listener at this point, you are forbidden from getting your news from this show. You're forbidden from thinking about this

Unknown 28:12
cannot be an important part of your news consumption do by Friday, kids just can't be

Unknown 28:16
And not only that, I'm not even doing that fake jon stewart thing where I go haha. I'm just a comedy person. No, seriously, read a fucking book. I'm going to mute now you guys talk.

Unknown 28:26
All right, well, so so we know about the concentration camps, these Trump concentration camps. I mean, obviously, they've been going on forever. You guys might remember a year ago, there was the big protest over the child separation policy. And this is basically people who come over the border, some of them many of them legally because they're claiming asylum which is which is not illegal, they've committed no crime. And they just sort of get as well as people who are who do have residency status or something that they're just getting mixed up into this. Because they're they're just sort of rounded up by by ice and a CPE and stuff. And they get put into these temporary what they're calling detention centers and these are some of them are old abandoned Walmart's some of them are tent cities under a bridge. Some of them are just like old military bases. But they get very hot in the day. Some of them are very cold at night. Some of them run the air conditioning all the time, so people are freezing. Reese last week, was in the news. There was a government lawyer arguing before a judge that the that there's a legal requirement, they provide detainees with safe and sanitary conditions, and choosing a legal argument that they do not have to provide toothpaste or soap as part of creating safe unsanitary conditions. You can watch a video of the government lawyer making that argument just on on YouTube. But we mainly know about the details of what's happening today from an article last week in New York Magazine. This is an interview with a lawyer who went to one of the detention centers on a fact finding mission. I don't know, quote from this lawyer who said, so quote, I know I know what I wanted to tell you. This is important. So on Wednesday, we received reports from children of a lice outbreak and one of the cells where there are about 25 children. And what they told us is that six of the children were found to have lice. And so they were given a lice shampoo and the other children were giving to combs and told to share those two combs to lice combs and brush their hair with the same combs, which is something you never do with a lice outbreak. And then what happened was one of the homes was lost and border patrol agents got so mad that they took away the children's blankets and mats, they weren't allowed to sleep on the bed. They had to sleep on the floor on Wednesday night as punishment for losing the home. So you had a whole cell full of kids who had beds and mats at one point, not for everybody. But for most of them who were then forced to sleep on the cement. And what was striking me that's just one little wonderful detail in this article that you love to hear about. But the thing that really stood out to me as someone who's spent a lot of my life like obsessing about Holocaust and Holocaust stories, is Did anyone read the Anne Frank's of diary of young women? many versions of that Do you remember how she died? The they don't know? No, we do unlike typhus, we wait. Yeah. So I think the popular conception is maybe the Anne Frank was killed in a gas chamber or something like that. I but she died of typhus, which is how most people died,

Unknown 31:10
like a month before the campus lip.

Unknown 31:12
Is this like an official stamp of like,

Unknown 31:14
yeah, we know. We know that. So. So I couldn't take that part out. And also,

Unknown 31:22
I just want to say like

Unknown 31:22
our periods were so bad,

Unknown 31:24
I thought looked at the she'd be a believer,

Unknown 31:26
part of the deal with concentration camps. It's not that you're gassing and executing everyone. It's that you're you're putting them into unsanitary conditions, and then they just die of disease. And you go, Oh, well, they were bad people. They weren't cleaning themselves. And of course, typhus, I believe, is actually spread by lies. So just a nice little, you know, just a nice little thing to think about. I guess I'm not gonna say Good one. I have really good one. It's a good bit, but now I'm sorry, I wouldn't

Unknown 31:52
want. What does this in service of we're telling people what we're telling people you're giving people background on why?

Unknown 31:58
Well, I have a thing I have it somewhere sky

Unknown 32:00
hapa. I'll mute again.

Unknown 32:01
This is also funny. There were other stories that we've heard from children such as that one of the guards has an older child who's 17 serve as the unofficial guard inside the rooms. So he tells the kids what to do. He tries to keep the room neat and straighten up the mattresses and everything. Now the guards reward him with extra food. And when a seven year old saw that this older boy is getting extra food by being helpful he has he can help kidding me clean up the room and keep it neat so that he

Unknown 32:24
doesn't What does that a student didn't run

Unknown 32:26
so that he could get extra food and the 17 year old chastise him for this. And then when an older sibling tried to stand up for his little brother the garden intervened and reprimanded both a little boy and his older brother so you know, you love to see

Unknown 32:39
that's it. Isn't that what it's called? June run?

Unknown 32:41
Yeah, that sounds right.

Unknown 32:42
That's no like but that's the that's the people who would get

Unknown 32:44
wasn't it like good Sabo, Jr. Or

Unknown 32:47
Yeah, well, I mean, there was the I mean, this happened in the ghettos happened there would be people wait a minute, I gotta meet again.

Unknown 32:55
So but I truly don't think people it's it's people like like, I did not grow up to a show so I didn't get the constant narrative of like people are could be coming for you is the constant narrative of like, you're dirty and God hates you. But I my great grandparents, my grandpa survived a concentration camp concentration. Oh boy. So he survived a concentration camp and like we would we would grow up with these stories and then but reading you know, and then it was this constant narrative and obsession of just like oh my god, I can't believe they went through this and reading stuff like this. I don't know. It just shakes something to your core and like I'm much farther removed from this than most people so I can't even imagine like I don't know how people aren't talking about this 24 seven I don't know why. Especially like Catholic folks. I don't know why I'm not like trying to break into the gates and like throwing ourselves against the walls like it's I don't know that I've

Unknown 33:59
thought about that about once a day since I read this. I was like, Yeah, I should go there and do something and then I'm like, What would I do like really think it through like what would you do? Like

Unknown 34:06
maybe you would be in jail and then nothing? Yeah, like I think Yeah,

Unknown 34:12
so Okay, well, here's a funny do by Friday angle on this so

Unknown 34:17
so there was a story that came out last night and this was Do you guys know the furniture company wayfarer? They're like they make this kind of cheap IKEA

Unknown 34:26
they got it they got just what you need.

Unknown 34:28
Yeah, they do like IKEA quality but but slightly designing furniture on an online

Unknown 34:33
wayfarers way further nobody left to my joke Are they the ones on msnbc?

Unknown 34:37
Oh, I don't watch it I don't know.

Unknown 34:38
Oh, yeah, me neither am I I mean

Unknown 34:44
it's like it's like a trendy online it's like you can buy like cheap knockoff made modern furniture for your urban apartment. On on wayfarer.

Unknown 34:52
Oh, hello, this looks lovely. Yeah,

Unknown 34:54
sorry.

Unknown 34:56
It's gonna it's gonna collapse in in a year but

Unknown 35:00
check it out Alex hashtag hashtag home.

Unknown 35:02
So anyway, it came out yesterday that wayfarer was was this company wayfarer was supplying beds to the detention centers. And the employees got really mad and they the management sent a letter saying hey, the Customs and Border Patrol or whatever they're just paying customers and will sell anyone a bed. And so there's a way you know, I believe tomorrow there's a way point to walk out and their headquarters in Boston and all the employees are going to walk out. So solidarity at least from two thirds of the do by Friday program with the lovers away point

Unknown 35:36
wayfarer wayfarer where we point is a pair of non podcaster

Unknown 35:42
Patrick Patrick is showing

Unknown 35:46
Austin

Unknown 35:48
wafer solidarity without with wayfarer and if anyone if you do want to quit You should quit first of all definitely quit but come work for us if you do. And here's the funny do by Friday angle and I guess Can you guys can i say i'm going to put a link in here. So this is a cert a Twitter's a link to a Twitter search for the phrase warfare and conflicted. Okay, guess what the take is on Twitter.

Unknown 36:11
Oh no.

Unknown 36:13
I mean that it's like I like laissez faire but uh, resistance grifter professional resistance grifter. Louise Mench says, I do not get this at all. Did we not protest that the children were sleeping on the ground without blankets and now we're protesting companies supplying the beds. Oh no. Go fuck yourself. Dan Kaminsky on Twitter. I'm juggling two strongly held opinions. One in supportive welfare workers. They didn't sign up for helping to build baby prisons to supportive the kids in these prisons. They need the beds. Holy shit. Give them the beds.

Unknown 36:47
Oh,

Unknown 36:48
oh, no. Are there no prisons? No. workhouses?

Unknown 36:51
isn't

Unknown 36:55
talking capacity people have to tie themselves into these like ethical question or like, just sweat pouring other fees. Like it could be good to give the prisons the beds to the child child prisons. Or could be bad. There's no way to know.

Unknown 37:11
Like, don't do it.

Unknown 37:13
Bad.

Unknown 37:14
There's no nuance to this. Do not do business with them. Oh, not nuanced in any way. You must not do business with that. But

Unknown 37:22
I've already paid my student debt

Unknown 37:27
into a jewelry store and found out someone got it for free fuck is

Unknown 37:31
wrong with people?

Unknown 37:34
What is that? Is that some sort of cognitive dissonance and you're like wrapping yourself into a pretzel like what is that we have

Unknown 37:41
to go and fuck up right as I was about to buy a chair from them. Now I'm conflicted.

Unknown 37:46
I literally was as soon as you said wayfarers, we get the website and then they're like, oh, cancel, cancel, cancel. I do not want this $9 pillow. No, no, I was

Unknown 37:54
conflicted on this because they do need beds but yes, this let's see here. I'm very conflicted on this. I hate for wayfarer to make money on this but at the same time I would rather kids sleeping in beds I just don't know emoji.

Unknown 38:09
Thank you. Thank you panda. You don't know.

Unknown 38:13
You cannot be part of this machinery. Like if it came out somehow that like like, like

Unknown 38:19
you're saying you throw yourself on the leavers, you throw yourself on the gears.

Unknown 38:22
You can't be part of it. Like you just can't like there isn't there any like, like, isn't there any more wine for

Unknown 38:28
these people? Everybody needs a hashtag home everybody needs a hashtag home. Like if it came out what the children children

Unknown 38:34
if it came up at CPV was like Playing Cards Against Humanity in these detention centers like a like in between their shifts. I spit on them. I would rather shut down the company then give themselves single back to them. Like I just won't be part of it.

Unknown 38:45
From Rules for Radicals. Hashtag holes.

Unknown 38:48
Is there any Isn't there any moral line for this episode?

Unknown 38:55
Don't have time to record a second episode

Unknown 39:00
was out last week. It was terrible.

Unknown 39:01
And now you made it more terrible. No, no, no this is

Unknown 39:08
this is this is this is being captain. Queen,

Unknown 39:13
Queen. And don't even don't even here's the other thing. Why do people when they screenshot someone like supporting fascist ideas they blur the username of them on Twitter. I'm like why is civility

Unknown 39:30
Okay,

Unknown 39:32
the social contract goes two ways. Like if you don't want to treat people

Unknown 39:36
say is that what you learned in the strip mall? It's a meeting of the minds is that

Unknown 39:41
that is that's what judge Walker says that is the civic space like it's a two way street create a payment

Unknown 39:47
if you're gonna if you're not going to agree to the like social bonds of keeping people's human rights and human dignity. And you think like whole groups of people should die

Unknown 39:56
not gonna be able to have foam in a glass smear.

Unknown 39:58
Yeah. Now you you lose your rights. People spit at you. Can I get

Unknown 40:04
a straw please? My father straws were his idea. moving air was a thing he thought of in 1978

Unknown 40:10
Hey, we weed legal in Illinois. So we got bad

Unknown 40:15
Cards Against Shannon corporation for

Unknown 40:32
I'm okay. All right. I wasn't gonna get I wasn't gonna dive into this because I feel like last week was a pretty depressing episode. And I don't like to bring. I mean, I don't want to I don't like bring politics into the show. But I don't know. The show

Unknown 40:49
Merlin UU changed

Unknown 40:51
and his Twitter list.

Unknown 40:53
Okay. All right. All right. I wasn't gonna say this. I'm pretty sure Levi's has discontinued the commuter proteins. Oh, yeah.

Unknown 41:01
No magic for me. No, no, no, they still make the shitty ones but the pro jeans they're not making any more. What about my needs? Who's gonna buy me a little bit?

Unknown 41:09
No, those were the last good ones. I know. We'll go look, I'm pretty sure they're gone. I don't like to bring politics into the show. I'm sorry. I'm looking at I'm on the Levi's website and I see Levi's commuter pro 511 slim fit stretch jeans black that's my GUC them on the site. Little commuter pro five Aight, they're off. out of stock. No.

Unknown 41:32
You got me hooked. You got me hooked. You did that. So I like the regular ones. The regular ones are nice, but these ones you guys got the fancy pockets on the inside. And what do you do the 511? Well, you caught me for the challenge. I had to buy pants and so I bought pants and the reflective because I ride my bike into my guess but I really liked him. The fit was fine. And I liked him a lot. And then I got the pro ones and I was like shit dog. Now this is some pants. These are some trousers I could put my boot. These are fucking trousers and like the pockets are special and nice. And I think they're not making them anymore. And I think that's a goddamn it's literally worse. Literally worse than concentration camps. They're

Unknown 42:08
reinforced in the crotch to prevent blow out.

Unknown 42:14
And they've all been sent there. Oh, this is very upsetting.

Unknown 42:17
Oh, now I'm sat

Unknown 42:18
Hoa and Nico.

Unknown 42:20
I was under the assumption that Levi's did the thing that Disney sort of used to do where it's like, oh, by these now or they're going away vault. Yeah.

Unknown 42:31
Sorry, Arielle. You're not going to be a part of anybody's fucking world. Now you live in a vault.

Unknown 42:35

Unknown 43:17
very, very different question. Is it?

Unknown 43:19
I know it is it is. I'm changing the question.

Unknown 43:21
Okay. So let me let me let me reframe your reframe which is the point in which my daughter says could you not wear the right brain? What are we gonna do about this? Now listen, can you use some of your estimable, estimable political power or spitting abilities to try and get us some last the let like hanging on to the pontoon as it leaves Vietnam Can you get us some communication jeans before they're totally gone? Or we got to go to fucking eBay

People who are like committed to a certain character and so much of the joke is in some ways dependent like if you know when we do that joke and like if you're a middle school kid and do those jokes is not as funny cuz you're not Mitch Hedberg. Right. But like, it's so like, in an environment like where people are drinking and yelling and stuff like that. You would think Oh, god, this is gonna fuck it up. He handled it all so well did not break character the whole time. And he was so fucking funny the whole time. He was incredible. He's God he's so fucking good.

Then from the actual show, probably. So like cold bear used to be on here, actually here in a minute. Amy Sedaris used to be on there. And this, I don't know why this this, this sketch gets me The setup is I took a break room, in an office environment and there's a woman sitting at a table by herself, and then two other women walk in and start talking to her. Hey,

Unknown 58:38
This was my first exposure to take Nitro and it's a bit cheated on Conan. But I still think the just the audio Hold up.

Unknown 58:48
I was performing in Seattle. And when I was on stage, I moved the stool next to me just slightly, and it made this weird noise that caused the entire audience to laugh, collect delay. I was like, that's all you guys need it.

Unknown 59:05
So I just kept pushing the store. And they kept laughing.

Unknown 59:11
So I just kept pushing the store. And they stopped laughing. So I kept pushing the stool. They started laughing again. It just kept going like that for a while. Good. 10 minutes. So just curious what you guys would think if I push the stool here.

Unknown 1:00:20
Maybe some of you aren't into it

Unknown 1:00:25
doesn't offend me.

Unknown 1:00:28

Unknown 1:01:31
The whole two minutes because

Unknown 1:01:34
I don't want to I don't want to Oh, I will not analyze that. But it would be fun to analyze why that's funny. I'm gonna say is do it. And then she did it. And then she committed and she kept doing

Unknown 1:01:43
Oh, it is my God. It's so good. It's so good. I'll put the link in Shawn is a horse Christian.

Unknown 1:01:56
Some standard comedians who I think are primarily funny, because because of their acting and their delivery, right, I would put Brian Regan I think Brian Regan is a competent writer, but he's a fucking brilliant performer. And his noises he makes his mannerisms on stage. I mean, they just make me belly laugh, even when the thing he's observing is a little bit, you know, an airplane joke or something like that. And then there are comedians that are primarily writers and their stuff is very heady and funny, but they're not the best, you know, they don't do like act outs and stuff. And then there are people who are the both like they're just nail it and take that bit from take was both for sure. like such a fucking funny delivery. Like, it wouldn't have worked that bit. You can't have done that bit without the acting that she brought to it and her character. But also you have to like how fucking clever to come up with that premise and write it and write it out.

Unknown 1:02:48
I mean, it seems kind of thing you Only you only could do. If it sounds stupid, but like you would have to know it's gonna work. Like how would you know either can't be a carpet there. There's all kinds of stuff where like, how would you know that gonna work?

Unknown 1:03:00
It's her. I mean, to me the the best comedy is that you have a worldview and you bring the audience into your worldview. Yes. And then they start to see the world like you do. And then just anything that's fun, doesn't matter what you're talking about. Like you're not having to say funny things. It's that you're saying things funny. But anyway, this is my favorite Santa bit ever that I've ever heard. And I think it's the best writing ever and stand up. It's a little long. I think I can get it down to like four or five minutes, but we may will have to cut it off at some point. But this is a George Carlin bit. And this is from I believe the album is jamming in New York,

Unknown 1:03:33
over 90% overweight over 90% of all the species that have ever lived on this planet ever lived are gone.

Unknown 1:03:43
They're extinct. We didn't kill them all. They just disappeared. That's what nature does. They disappear these days at the rate of 25 a day and I mean regardless of our our behavior, irrespective of how we act in this world minus 25 species that were here today will be gone tomorrow. Let them go gracefully. Leave nature alone Haven't we done enough? With so self important? So self important? Everybody's going to save something now? Save the tree save the be Save the Whales see those nails? And the greatest arrogance of all save the planet? What are these fucking people kidding me?

Unknown 1:04:28
save the planet. We don't even know how

Unknown 1:04:30
to take care of ourselves. We haven't learned how to care

Unknown 1:04:32
for one another we're going to save the fucking planet.

Unknown 1:04:45
Earth Day I'm tired of these self righteous environmentalists these white liberals who think the only thing wrong with this country is there aren't enough bicycle paths. People trying to make the world safe for their Volvo's. Besides, environmentalists don't give a shit about the planet. They don't care about the planet not in the abstract. They don't. Not in the abstract. They don't you know what they're interested in a clean place to live their own habitat. They're worried that someday in the future, they might be personally inconvenienced. Narrow, unenlightened self interest doesn't impress me. Besides, there is nothing wrong with the planet. Nothing wrong with the planet. The planet is fine. The people are fucked.

Unknown 1:05:40
Oh, boy. He was so good. The best.

Unknown 1:05:46
We do one more.

Unknown 1:05:46
One more. No, no, no.

Unknown 1:05:50
do have another but you're not gonna like a mini

Unknown 1:05:55

Unknown 1:06:04
Um, my late father was a wonderful man. And he had a great sense of humor that even I can remember from being seven years old and my father's favorite comedian was a guy who was one of the early TV stars and who, whose style of comedy was so very odd. If you haven't ever checked out Ernie Kovacs listeners go out and find some Ernie Kovacs. Because he was to say he was ahead of his time is not even getting close anyhow, timestamp here, this is an album I had as a kid and I would listen to incessantly and for some reason, this was my this is my problem. My favorite thing on the album, I think it plays well as audio, because it is an album, but it um, but there's so many times in life or three or four times a month. I think of this bit. For reasons that will seem obvious maybe the bit is called gringo.

I have one from one of my favorite stina albums ever. And this is Ellen DeGeneres, his album taste this. And this is probably her. It's probably the most famous stand up bit. I think she actually touches on that Dave Letterman. Netflix.

Unknown 1:10:52
My next guest New Zealand. Yeah, she talked

Unknown 1:10:55
about this bit and change her career. But I do think this is one of the all time greats conceits and executions of all time. And it's just the whole thing is kind of like like one one act out on a premise and it's just it's just think think of how it How could you have written this like it's so good, so I don't know I just this one blows my mind of just like it's better. It's a better concept and a better execution than probably any comedy thing I'll ever do.

Unknown 1:11:22
So So here's the thing I feel like that everything on this earth is here for a reason. That's just my opinion. I think that there are no mistakes. And I think that even if you don't understand why one thing is here, you find out later it works with ecosystem somewhere else that does something I don't understand why we have fleas here because please do nothing at all beneficial, but I thought at times like this We can't figure it out for ourselves wouldn't be great if we could just pick up the phone and call up God and ask him these things. Just pick up the phone call up God
