Unknown 1:06
a slap in the face of this rich tradition we have evolving fake cartoon animals. What a shame What a shame for the children. Once

Unknown 1:14
you get Pokemon home, I have to imagine that some sort of Ghostbusters style vault that you have in your house that contains the Pokemon

Unknown 1:22
and they get so fucking

Unknown 1:24
enraged. And what's going to happen is what's going to happen is one day the power is going to go out and then you're gonna have to have the exterminator come over. He's gonna be shining his flashlight on the couch. He goes maybe I see a problem. Let me tell you what. I see the problem right here. There's your problem right there. Your house is teeming with Pokemon you've got pocketable monsters. You've got Pokemon home.

Unknown 1:58
I have agreements I'd like to bring to the attention of the podcast, please do. So the last three three times Veronica have gone out of town matchy has cats it for us. And he's taken such good care of Captain Janeway. She loves him. He's like always on time. Like actually like actually the best cat sitter and also like, is so responsible that Veronica you know, Veronica, we're very particular about our cat we think about her a lot. We've got a Pokemon home but for the cat. And we feel we always feel very good with with matchy watching the cat. And I have offered it for the first time I texted matching. I was like could you can't sit for it. Because Let me also say, Man, she does this professionally. It's part of their job is that they do

Unknown 2:46
it doesn't doesn't match. You had that as like a special DND ability, like a way to sue the animals. Isn't that isn't that part of his profile?

Unknown 2:53
And basically he watches broken.

Unknown 3:00
Got a candidate for him right here.

Unknown 3:01
So I texted him. And I said we're going out of town. You know we not we have other people that we can't sit there like they bailed or something happened. I can't remember and they wouldn't work out. And so we texted matches like can I hire you hire to watch my cat. And now what does that mean? It means I Okay, first of all, I would like you to do it. Would you do it? Second of all, I would say that that means for money. If the word hires in there, I'm saying I front the deal is I'll give you some money for this. So magic came for like over a week watch the cat. The cat was so happy when we came back and everything was great. And then I text matches IK Just a reminder invoice me for that cat setting. Never happened, then we had to go out of town again. Several months later, I

Unknown 3:50
have a personal relationship where you requested

Unknown 3:54
to do it. I'm like, you

Unknown 3:56
I agree. No, you're absolutely right.

Unknown 3:58
Except, and I remember the reason this being weird. The first time is Veronica just asked him first and like, Hey, can you watch the cat? And of course, he was like, Oh, yeah, totally. This is this is easy. It's normal. It's happened a long

Unknown 4:15
time again. And I said, Matt, you were going out of town again for like another week. And I would like to

Unknown 4:20
remind you Oh, now you know you're in arrears.

Unknown 4:23
Yes. And I was like, and I was like, Listen, Please, could you invoice us for the last time we can set? And also could you give me a quote so that I can pay you to cats it again for another one as part of your as part of your career as part of your job. As part of your career and your job that you do. Would you also watch my cat? And he was like, Yes, I'll do it. And then afterwards, I was like, I was like, please advise me. And the match was like, No, I really love spending time with your cat. I don't want to do it.

Unknown 4:51
And then it was just oh, this is a long con max. This is a big big Griffin.

Unknown 4:56
And then we were out of town just just last weekend. And I know it's just one day but you guys just got back from WWDC and I texted a match again. Okay, I know it's you're just back from dub dub. But could you watch? Did you watch the academy? And he was like, Yes. did a great job. Everything was great. And please let me tell you, please.

Max is here and we're literally talking to thousands of people right now. So if you don't want to get a ton, a ton of tweets literally dozens of tweets please invoice

Unknown 5:51
Okay, please. I demand to pay you for cats.

Unknown 5:55
Please help me pay you. So I know eventually that we're you're going to kill the cat and then we're going to be sued into oblivion, but for now, not if there's not a

I actually don't know what it costs to hire Maddie for counseling. But I'm going to say at this point we're Thousand Words are we're like at least a couple hundred dollars into it.

Unknown 6:55
I don't know.

Unknown 6:57
Listen, Maxie, when you went to law school in a strip mall, you know how this works? Just because just because you choose to offer a proper a proper proper proper of a gift. unilaterally may not absolve you of the business necessity of the invoice amount if it exists, which it doesn't.

Unknown 7:18
I would say that could be a quid pro quo or patent. I'm not sure I don't remember

Unknown 7:21
it could be quid pro quo. Oh, so what kind of person what are we talking about?

Unknown 7:27
What Yeah, I think I think we're Alex What do you think we're into it? Because it's over.

Unknown 7:31
We'll be talking about an edible arrangement or like like a good clean vehicle. What are we talking about maybe

Unknown 7:36
an arrangement of edible scene? And I mean, we're never going to deny edibles.

Unknown 7:43
Guess how the only way I know how to buy weed anymore is

Unknown 7:50
anyway, the thing is, I truly don't know because all of the cats and dogs that he takes care of our like truly broken like like Maria Maria cat that needs a wheelchair. It's like that

Unknown 8:03
broken

Unknown 8:05
human wheelchair

Unknown 8:10
Are you talking about like a little cart? Like there's literally a little see enough is a little tiny like a brand Stark wheelchair that would be so

Unknown 8:16
I swear to God, that is an actual that's not

Unknown 8:19
how money works.

Unknown 8:20
I know how money it's it's uncharted territory, because literally, I have no idea

Unknown 8:26
which one would pay? Okay, but so how much it at this point? We're well over two weeks. I mean,

Unknown 8:32
this is this is not a bit this is not my business transaction.

Unknown 8:36
Oh, no, not my circus, not my monkeys is what you're saying.

Unknown 8:38
Although now I'm wondering if you know, but you know, better than me not not in business. We don't have any business transactions. That would be

Unknown 8:50
one of you. Alex has never said invoice me

Unknown 8:52
one of you as a wife. So I

Unknown 9:14
gotta say who gets

Unknown 9:17
mad about the remote?

Unknown 9:19
Get the spot on the couch who gets put their phone there?

Unknown 9:25
Well, Father's Day is coming up who gets a card who gets card

Unknown 9:28
gets a card. The problem is we both get Oh, this is another thing.

Unknown 9:32
Are you The daddy? No, I thought we did. I thought we decided yesterday I asked if I could call you mommy and you agreed that I could call you mommy. So are you switching this up on me? Don't be a parent

Unknown 9:40
normative. You can. You can see, I believe a mommy and daddy serve very different purposes. I know.

Unknown 9:49
I know. We're doing one of our hilarious bits right now.

Unknown 9:54
This is transphobic.

Unknown 9:56
Sorry. Yeah, come on. Thank you.

Unknown 10:00
Serious, please. I want to

Unknown 10:03
know what is this bothering you?

Unknown 10:06
Crazy, because if I feel

Unknown 10:09
like man, he does such a good job. And you so responsible and I just want to pay him for doing the thing that he does. It would be like if someone asked me to design a game for them from money and then refuse to let like pay me like, weird. It's like their job. I feel terrible

Unknown 10:25
that Okay, here's here's, here's a sort of, it's like if someone asked you to play test a game versus design a game

Unknown 10:34
I also would probably actually, you

Unknown 10:38
know, I mean, it's all

Unknown 10:40
bad example. It's all bad.

Unknown 10:43
Alex, you don't get rich in life by refusing money. You know what I'm saying? Yes.

Unknown 10:46
What's,

Unknown 10:47
what's something that Matty would really like? That's in the hundreds of dollars range to be left alone.

Unknown 10:54
Other than that,

Unknown 10:55
other than that, yeah, a good.

Unknown 10:58
Expensive is the cat robot? Fear.

Unknown 11:03
Honestly, that's that seems about that's

Unknown 11:04
okay. isn't like that's a four figure. That's a four figure, isn't it? I looked at I want No,

Unknown 11:08
no, not No. I don't care what normal ones. I don't care.

Unknown 11:14
See, and I think that's the other thing. We have many socialist friends who watch our cats and we always barter.

Unknown 11:23
If we won't take our money,

Unknown 11:26
I actually understand where Max is coming from like, please, I grew up this way. How do I give you money? Just let me give it to you.

Unknown 11:34
How did they buy their socialist bread if they don't have money? Yeah,

Unknown 11:36
but here's the thing is Maddie does this. It's not just a favor, because Maddie does this as part of his job. And the opportunity cost of watching Janeway is the man he doesn't have another client that's paying them. Does that make sense? You know,

Unknown 11:51
I think it's more that you realize that you are unintentionally in debt. And you don't know how much and you don't know.

Unknown 12:02
It's a Midwest type thing.

Unknown 12:04
No, certainly you absolutely have a personal sense of justice. Yeah, I see that all the time. But, but I'm saying I'm saying that Max is sitting there because I hear him be me. Like, I know I'm in debt, but I don't know how much I don't know how to fix it. It's a it's a living nightmare. One

Unknown 12:17
day mad, he's just gonna come knocking on the door and be like, Hello, hello, excuse me. Or shotgun against the door? I

Unknown 12:32
know, listen, if someone asked

Unknown 12:35
me to do something, in the in the realm of my professional boy, if someone asked me to do something for them in the realm of my, like, professional responsibilities that I do for money to make a living, and they asked me to do it for free, and they were a friend and I care and I liked their thing or whatever, I might say yes, but I'm fucking gritting my teeth and I'm looking at the clock and I'm going home what's your mind? And then go here and then if they don't ever get me are offered whatever make it right. I need hearing that you have no idea how long I'll be mad about that decade. Oh, and I'll be thinking about what the fuck that person had me make their website and they didn't even thank me and they just came to me with problems and I updated and it doesn't work anymore. And it's like, I'm still mad at people who asked me to make their website for free.

Unknown 13:19
They don't listen,

Unknown 13:20
let me ask you this. Let me ask you this you go out to dinner and this this came up on a bam bam question. I heard recently an old one. But um, you know either the situations where I think the question on the MM was like you you're with your like, I think was with his like, his girlfriend's family invites him out to dinner. And he wasn't sure like cuz you know how it is you have times in life where you just don't have any know. And it's like, I've been to dinner where somebody decides to order wine and it like wrecks me for the week. Right? Those you're like you know that feeling right? You know that feeling of like, I really can't I it's so easy for this to be something I can't afford at all. And like even if I can barely afford it this is not how I would spend the money. Let me ask you this. If a party involved in a dining out experience has the intention of paying for probably all of the meal at what point is it ethical hmm and what point is it moral for that person to announce their intent to pay for all of the diners Oh,

Unknown 14:21
what a good question.

Unknown 14:23
I Okay,

Unknown 14:24
okay, cuz cuz there's this is this is so is this I mean, people don't do Dutch as much as most like you used to like we got six different ways it's the worst nobody but like like if you're gonna do it, are you gonna pay for everybody? Are you gonna pay for some Are you going to pay for the poor college students and is it your obligation from an ethical standpoint to say it before you order when you sit down when do you say

Unknown 14:44
I have this problem? No, I have this problem in my life all the time because I have a lot of broke ass friends you know I got really lucky and I'm and I may have this car game is successful and I can afford to go out to eat and take my friends out and have a lot of like broke ass friends who can't really afford to go out to eat and so I often I love sitting in restaurants and like talking to people forever and not not like a linear just like a normal ass you know, diner or whatever, but it's still like I always will pick up the check. And I always have that fantasy even when I was broken. I was in college and I always had that thing in the back of my head of man if I ever like make a ton of money I'm gonna have I'm gonna fucking love picking up the check at the diner and you know what everyone's pancakes you know what I always thought that I had a few people would do that for me sometimes. And I would go that's the coolest

Unknown 15:27
and not not not nothing not to seem fancy but just because it's such a nice thing to do

Unknown 15:31
no and so I so I was out in college one time with I wish I remember who someone who had some money or something I don't remember and they did this move where they had somehow called ahead or gotten up from the table and gave their card to the waiter and said you know what, don't ring the bell just just charge me and I'll and I'll get it from you later and that way no all knows what's happening. And I was sitting there having dinner and I was doing that thing where I was looking at the drinks everyone was ordering and I was sweating and I was like cash Do I have and like you know have overdraft my account and I was you know that real panic Absolutely. Hundred percent I can feel it right This sucks. How humiliating is this going to be for me? And then there was that moment of we were done and someone was like, Okay, well, we can't leave we didn't get the check. And then the guy was like, you know what I already took care of everyone have a great night. And I was like there's like the relief I felt come with like god damn that's like the coolest thing in the world. Okay,

Unknown 16:25
so you do it but you're a with holder and Yo, check arise that guy pulled the power move

Unknown 16:32
a little bit he knew that you everyone there was broke and college kids are

Unknown 16:40
you worried that you worry they're gonna wear a lobsters or something? Because Because Because my move would be to just quietly say, Hey, you know what? I love it. If you let me take care of tonight. You say that's it. We're done. Nobody order because because then you're like, ah, like, do I

Unknown 16:55
doesn't that in a way is that two to two Potlatch. Okay, my, my fear is that that in a way that that colors the meal?

Unknown 17:04
Yeah, no, I know. And it's like, it gets rid of all the mystery. It gets rid of them, you know,

Unknown 17:09
in the way that I feel like when I see matchy now I'm like, feel weird because I'm like, I owe you something.

Unknown 17:16
I owe you something. But I don't know what it's killing me.

Unknown 17:19
But I feel guilty. I feel guilty. It's weird. I feel like I feel weird. It's on my mind. So

Unknown 17:24
So okay, and if and if

Unknown 17:26
you got enough, I'm like, Hey, I'm taking everyone out for dinner. That conversations gonna be a little weird, because everyone knows I'm paying for it. And I don't want it to be weird. Yeah, sure. I don't want to establish up a power.

Unknown 17:37
Now they have to watch your magic effects. Here's

Unknown 17:39
why you are again, you know, on top of, well, I'm going to call out Max's privilege here. Every Yep. You're You're welcome. You're welcome. At least when you go out to dinner with a group of people that's like the all the broke ass game developers. I don't think anybody will actually I've seen people assume and it was weird. But like, when you like all the interns are like, Hey, how are we going to split this and Max is like, Everyone calm down. But like so I can understand that move with and like everybody knows dad is going to either pay or not be or say like, hey, these are great. They're cheap,

Unknown 18:19
not gonna pick up anybody by their lapels and shake them till quite

Unknown 18:23
right right? But I can understand in a like, oh, we're paying for your

Unknown 18:27
clubs.

Unknown 18:29
Like well, exactly. What do you do in a situation like I also don't have this problems give

Unknown 18:34
me hives just hearing this is fucking Right.

Unknown 18:37
Right. Like all of my like, there's I think there's also this understanding amongst millennials also, like, who doesn't have a job who is currently working on a freelance thing and it's almost like a before dinner. It's like, Hey, is this place it? There's way less shame in saying, is this place too expensive for like everybody to go? Do you think we should go someplace more low key? Like there's way less shame associated?

Unknown 19:02
I have I have a lot of friends.

Unknown 19:03
Who if I invite them, you know, well, and that's the thing with you though. What about when it's all the fancy boys like who picks up the cheddar cards? The cards guys? No, no, like, welcome back

Unknown 19:12
to that because they squabble over it. Like, like little boys. Yeah, they go, Oh, I didn't eat any of the cheese plate.

Unknown 19:21
We used to go out to lunch at my office in Tallahassee, we used to go out to lunch and and I'm many more than one occasion. I I was like, Look, we got to get back to work. And they'd be like, you know, which one had the aftermarket cheese on the fries. And I only had a cold I would go

Unknown 19:42
I would just grab the check and go leave

Unknown 19:45
now.

Unknown 19:48
And I will cover the tip because everybody knows, you know, baby does the thing we throw in a buck or two at the end and Brent fucking Brent, who was a PhD would go last leave the last MPO a Bucher to F off of the pile? The fucking PhD would do that. And I would see everyone leave your vehicles. vehicles of your fucking

Unknown 20:18
wobbling

Unknown 20:21
no one cares about your

Unknown 20:25
fucking cock.

Unknown 20:27
It's the worst. It's the

Unknown 20:30
worst. Now, here's the other thing. I don't know if we'll ever do a challenge where we get to pitch a business idea. But there should be as I have.

Unknown 20:41
origin story started at a barbecue place.

Unknown 20:56
Step away from the table.

Unknown 20:59
He's going guard Mirlande.

Unknown 21:10
I've always said that we need more like we don't know how to talk to each other anymore. We don't know how to stand in lines, something something opinion piece. But here's the thing. We all Don't Don't we all agree that there should be a mutual mutually understandable way to signal to a person driving a car on your behalf. There should be way to signal

Unknown 21:31
as the consumer, you could say, a hand signal, just a just a code word.

Unknown 21:37
Say it would be fine with me if we minimized talk. Well, look, don't feel like you need to talk to entertain me. And like you could kind of have this cool thing like a Yale handshake. It would let both of you know it's okay. If we don't talk that is very necessary. I think now maybe we need something similar when you go out when you go out to lunch or hopefully not with with Brent. But like there should be a way to signal I got this maybe some kind of Jedi Mind move. But is it Max is concerned that didn't that sublease the conversation? at the diner? We do the hand gesture? Well, I'll say like the bigger

Unknown 22:12
Okay, here's the bigger thing to me is that the thing to consider is like, I love going out, especially like I fucking love sitting at like a diner, you get those big, thick coffee mugs. And you just sit and talk with someone for like two hours. Those are honestly some of the best memories of my life and some of the most like best ideas that are, you know, and the most fun conversations like I love like I live for that. And I have a whole lot of friends who if I'm like, hey, let's go out to the you know, let's let's go to the diner and sit and talk. Like, that's non trivial for them to like, order dinner, right? They were planning that was their night that they needed to stay home and cook for budget reasons. And what are we talking about? we're each going to order $20 of food. I mean, I mean, maybe we go crazy mean shorter. $40 If I mean what like, like, if the value of that conversation is if I were to pay for that whole tab. It's so much more than 100 bucks than 80 bucks. And that's that's how you don't y'all so you don't spend that much you're trying to make the point. Even if

Unknown 23:08
you got pancakes for the table the entire thing like you said the value of the interaction, the environment, the conviviality of getting to have just it sounds stupid as you get older you start to realize the value of like just being being one little group of people for a little while and that sticks with you so much longer than like you know five episodes of TV it's really it's really nice

Unknown 23:28
when we've got the when we ate this episode of steak with without with Todd that was a wonderful that was so much that was

Unknown 23:33
a lot of fun. Did you think you paid for that didn't you don't remember I'd had some drinks like I gave I called

Unknown 23:39
I called ahead and gave them my card Oh you're so and I said don't bring don't bring the check to the table because I didn't want to fight about it.

Unknown 23:44
Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my greatest effect was after you left I took a few dollars off the table

Unknown 23:54
chicken breast was rather dry

Unknown 23:57
the whole thing is like it is it's a weird it's a weird power and emotional thing because it's just it's very fraught and and it's weird because like I know they're sweating like well what if I get you know $20 of food or whatever and I'm like I don't care like what am I going to go to my I'm going to go to my grave and I'm going to be mad that I spent $20 to have a great conversation with my friend for hours like are you crazy we got it we got so

Unknown 24:24
at a time when Why then girlfriend my now wife and I could scarcely afford it I mean literally scarcity like not afford it we were we were both in a situation where we did not have a lot of extra cash. We ended up getting like a four quadrant cock up where it was like the other person chose the place very fancy. The other person dropped in some wine it's over $100 a bottle like the whole thing just went so wrong and the entire time we were just sitting there like just sphincter is locked like hoping that we were going to be able to get out of this staying alive with our dignity it's the worst feeling in because you can't go like oh you know Don't you think maybe we could just you know have sparkling water like oh my god you just ordered another bottle of wine. Do you realize what this is doing to me? It's the worst feeling I hate it

Unknown 25:17
honestly at this point in my life I usually don't go out to dinner to places unless I know that I could buy every ticket because it good you know what the and in fact that's good. And the other thing too is that there was a place like we went with some friends to like a number of dinners over the course of the night and I'm like where it was like understood like don't worry this is how like these restaurants split the check this these ways and I'm like guys do not stress out I would like to pay my share equally even though it's going to look like I'm having playing food but it's just the same amount of like care and preparation so weird that you have to say that but you're right at this Michelin star yeah was like no one and and then however they still did it but I was like like please no one stress about this like I'm going to be drinking like you guys it's still prepared and like I'm gonna be eating the bread the experience

Unknown 26:13
like look like I'm hooking up nutrient sack

Unknown 26:18
my put

Unknown 26:21
my macros

Unknown 26:23
I will insert these nutrients into my clothes and exude a milk like substance like all monitoring.

Unknown 26:30
Please everyone please understand that the value the

Unknown 26:33
value of the experience is what it's all I care about.

Unknown 26:36
Well, honestly, it's easier no

Unknown 26:38
joy taking all those lives while I bread.

Unknown 26:42
Well, okay, okay, let's get let's get to another level. Don't what Please

Unknown 26:46
don't mind me. I'll be over here. Just catch us all white.

Unknown 26:49
Are you making fun of my energy tablets that I'm having right now and my water? I can't tell Oh, how's it working? Oh, we got a well this is let whoa, hold on. This is a genuine question that I had. Okay.

Unknown 27:06
Dark Alex.

Unknown 27:08
I mean, really, that's a problematic phrase. But what happened?

Unknown 27:14
You're in a good mood today. I like

Unknown 27:16
it. Is there a sports is there a sports drink? There's you know, some sort of sport drink called catcher saw white? I can't believe no one has done this before. catches catches catches on. There's three people listening the podcast who thinks that this is very funny.

Unknown 27:28
No, wait.

Unknown 27:31
Wait.

Unknown 27:33
Oh,

Unknown 27:34
okay. I see. What

Unknown 27:36
did he get some sort of like one of those like, you know, Gator aids at the gym you like? Yeah, hang on. I gotta get a catch. All right, I gotta slam this thing.

Unknown 27:43
Again. This is like me making a Pokemon joke. What happens when you're going out to dinner with your in laws are funny and you

Unknown 27:56
the space jokes pity

Unknown 28:06
pity mouth

Unknown 28:06
little pity. We have a tiny one here for little job.

Unknown 28:09
I've gotten a number of pity bells in my day.

Unknown 28:12
So little.

Unknown 28:20
Oh, so analyze what happens

Unknown 28:22
when you wanted? Like, okay, my, my family grew up middle class and was very much like a like, everybody splits the check. Unless it or like all the families split, split the check unless it is the father of somebody because everyone was in the same social class. The like, the families were middle class and the grandparents were all like, upper middle class. And it was, I don't know how it happened. It was just kind of understood. And there was I

Unknown 28:48
think I know I don't want to interrupt you. But I totally know what you're saying. I think you're right. In fact, it is that we call going Dutch I don't know if that's racist. But like when you when you go, you know, there's no any question about what to split the bill. And it is actually necessary. It's almost like a little bit like Middle Eastern or something. There's a necessary amount of haggling to be sure that it is exactly right. So it's like my friend Michael Ferguson used to say when we when we live together in college, he said if you talk about the money once you never have to talk about it again. And if you don't talk about the money, you will unintentionally be talking about it for the rest of your life. Right? It's that kind of like clarity in relationship the siblings at this level always interact this way. Now if big pork is in attendance like at the end with with the throne and whatnot, then then in that case, there's a good chance the bill will be picked up

Unknown 29:36
yeah you know I'm getting an extra chicken breast when big pork is there like my

Unknown 29:51
big pop

Unknown 30:07
but like okay so so I mean there is the obvious like performative haggling amongst the dads before grandpa like the the mini ports are like, Oh, I want to pick it up. I want to pick it up and then a big fork is like he's what he's called ahead he's like slipped the waitress like like money to basically be like, no, really they're gonna fight you just go run this card. But But if you know you're in this is coming from I feel like a really deep place. Like you know that your in laws are from like, a much lower middle class, and you really just want to take them out to dinner. Not even like, like they Okay, TGI Fridays, one of their favorite restaurants don't add me their vodka. slushies are great. I know

Unknown 30:52
there's no there's no accounting, there's no accounting for taste. The heart wants what it wants. Nobody has accepted it more than they hate.

Unknown 30:57
Exactly, exactly. And you just, you just want to like, be like, please, it's like there once a month thing. Like, let me spend the like $50 like, please let me let me get you fully loaded nachos. Oh, God, like, these still slip us gas money. And I'm like, Oh, I know what like I understand that is like they they really true. Like my family finally understood. Exactly, exactly. Like they understand like, okay, for the meantime, a job like, we don't need to make sure that like she's not dead. But they like my in laws truly don't understand, like, what I and I, but now I think I figured it out. I find out where

Unknown 31:42
we're at Alex, how do you explain it to them?

Unknown 31:45
How do I explain it to this? I

Unknown 31:46
think I might have a feeling about what the problem is. Okay, so Exactly.

Unknown 31:49
I tried to because they're in my in laws, and I close with them. I tried to explain what my job actually is, which is a lot and many mazes. And and the other problem is I mentioned podcasts. No, no, no, never again. And now I just say, I work for Cards Against Humanity. And I do tech for events, and I manage the studio and basically, you know, make sure all the cables are plugged in. And that has kind of stopped it. And then they just want to hear about the game. And then it's like, yeah, it's really fun and move on. But they're like, wait, so a pod. What is it? I didn't know people used iPods. Oh,

Unknown 32:31
however, I gotta be careful. Because you if you say you know if you were to say like I make movies, or now that's going to pivot to OCR in Hollywood, like you have to be careful what language you use with stuff like podcast, because you end up explaining less.

Unknown 32:44
Exactly, yep, yep. And yeah, so so now they're kind of in like, okay, you can pay rent. Good, that's fine. But I they still want to pick up the check every time. But I think I've got it. I find out where we're going into advance or I know like all their favorite restaurants. And I have I have acquired a number of gift cards for each of those restaurants. And I'm like, Oh, don't worry, I have a gift card. And this has happened for three months in a row. And I wonder,

Unknown 33:13
oh, you're at dinner with them. You whip out the gift.

Unknown 33:15
When they're like when the check comes? And they're like, No, no, let me get into like,

Unknown 33:19
oh, wait a minute, I'm pretty sure.

Unknown 33:22
Like literally into the Amy Poehler thing where you're like, black like you're looking for your wallet.

Unknown 33:32
I see. I'm like oh

Unknown 33:42
Applebee's gift cards that have like Applebee's TGI Fridays chilis an olive garden.

Unknown 33:49
Like in the 90s you have a CD wallet like a big book of CD. If you open it up, it was just loaded with gift cards, hundred dollar gift cards for every chain restaurant. Barbie's?

Unknown 34:05
No, no, no, that's the problem is they're going to figure out if I just put like, if I sir refilling an olive garden gift card every month, they're going to figure it out. So I have one that's clearly says like $25 on it and they're like, okay, we'll do the remainder and it's like five.

Unknown 34:20
This is so devious. You are so good. That's so DD

Unknown 34:23
I am I am telling no lies. I am not being misleading by saying I can't use this in Chicago. The only Well, I guess it could be there. I found out there is an olive garden actually disgustingly close to our office. So I'm very nervous about that. But I'm like, the only Fridays is downtown. We're not going to go downtown. You know, no, no, let me use it.

Unknown 34:44
You know what I you should I think you should leave them maybe you should have you have the the the grand hospital the NEA. If it's if it's at a you can Olive Garden, whatever. The maitre D at TGI Fridays, comes over and says congratulations. You're our 15,000 consumer. This one's on us and they just dropped a bunch of gift cards on the table.

Unknown 35:07
But but that's a lie ticket.

Unknown 35:09
You know saying that isn't max isn't that basic misdirection? just basic misdirection. Look over there. Look at the man over there.

Unknown 35:14
I'm fine with misdirection of straight out like Like, if they were to ask me, did you buy these gift cards? So that you would pay for dinner? I would be like, Oh, you got me. And then it we'd all have a laugh. But really, they probably would resent me for them in the next 20 years. But that's a gamble I'm willing to make. The other thing I can think of I've thought of doing is it. They're like, Oh, you always have gift cards. I can go well, I don't know if it'll work. And when the server comes over, I can say can you just check and make sure this gift card works because that's technically not a lie. I don't the machine could be broke. There might not

Unknown 35:53
be dark horse my friends. Unbelievable.

Unknown 35:56
Making Ocean's 11 style heights on your family.

Unknown 36:01
This fall out of your MIMO I think this fell out of your purse stack of gift

Unknown 36:04
cards. Got a demolitions guy on the roof ready to

Unknown 36:09
die on the trolley.

Unknown 36:22
Oh

Unknown 36:23
my goodness. Okay, now here is kind of give you okay, I love this. Can I give you just one note to be careful. Okay. All right. So please Have you ever seen it happen? Let's say for example, your king pork. Like, at a certain point, somebody goes, Oh, it's funny. I found this figurine of a pig I'm going to give because i think i think this person I think of pigs. I had a friend who was an elephant lady. Were like every birthday. So one time one time, right? It's like, like cooter burger, it's cooter burger all over again. One time, they said they liked elephants and then somebody gave them an elephant. And then especially if you're a lady, not another birthday or Christmas goes by that you don't receive and what

Unknown 37:03
is that sketch first birthday from SNL Where?

Unknown 37:09
I'm an angel.

Unknown 37:12
Oh my god. It's so good. Yeah. Oh, boy.

Unknown 37:18
You have become the chicken.

Unknown 37:20
Wait, was there an end to that story? This is

Unknown 37:24
an Alex story. That was basically a question and the answer is Yeah, no,

Unknown 37:28
I didn't know I did more of a john Siracusa where I just tried to tell a joke with

Unknown 37:32
Listen, I got into my I gotta keep this thing on track because I gotta get to my worms shortly. Oh, the worms.

Unknown 37:37
What I'm saying is be careful that you don't become the TGI Fridays gift card lady is what I'm saying.

Unknown 37:42
I will. That's why I varied up. I have a challenge on

Unknown 37:50
Merlin's for being

Unknown 37:51
no Alex Alex GC. She's there feeding me feeding the

Unknown 37:56
Beans.

Unknown 37:58
Beans. No means no beans.

Unknown 38:02
JACK you and me and I was there feeding you feeding you

Unknown 38:04
all right, boy.

Unknown 38:06
Bring the ruckus. Hang on. I have a I'm having a problem here where my headphones are cutting in and out and I can't I'm having a lot of trouble

Unknown 38:13
here. Oh no.

Unknown 38:14
Cameron. Well, maybe if you paid matchy they'd work better.

Unknown 38:17
We just replace that one.

Unknown 38:20
Did you though? I don't think you did

Unknown 38:22
these guys. Yeah, we didn't recess them.

Unknown 38:24
It's loose. I mean, it's not been replaced.

Unknown 38:26
What kind of work do you do Alex? No, I might disappoint max

Unknown 38:31
the Yeah.

Unknown 38:33
This one is working. This one might have been replaced. He sounds nice. This one hasn't been replaced because it's just it's just a loose. It's like a loose tooth. wiggling around in there.

Unknown 38:42
Oh, like Fred, Fred. Fred. Fred van fleet. Am I right? ready to pop right

Unknown 38:45
out? Here you guys watch. You guys watching Berry.

Unknown 38:49
Berry no watching Barry.

Unknown 38:51
I keep I have a season to drop off problem lately. Cameron.

Unknown 38:55
You watch him Barry. Did you anyone watch Season One of Barry. No,

Unknown 38:59
I don't watch him Barry. I didn't watch patriots season two. I don't know what's wrong. I know.

Unknown 39:02
No one watched you didn't even watch season one a berry.

Unknown 39:05
No.

Unknown 39:07
Yes. You like it? I didn't watch it. Okay, yeah, I heard it's good. No, I loved it. I loved it. But even killing me and killing he has been a real slow burn for the second season. Oh, I I it's so good.

Unknown 39:20
I really I really liked Barry and hit a lot of the same notes for me as

Unknown 39:25
a patriot or bad and very funny

Unknown 39:28
and not and not just as just saying not in the obvious way. It's not just about Hitman stuff. It's also like this impossible balance of of humor, sweetness. grisliness, right? Like without being Campion, Quentin Tarantino about, it's amazing what they are able to balance with that show.

Unknown 39:43
I really, I'm really digging it and I just I just sort of powered through season two, and it was so good.

Unknown 39:49
Okay. All right. I'm going to put on the

Unknown 39:50
give give a big old recommendation of Barry. And it's, you know, there's only eight episodes there. 30 minutes. Yeah, it's I like that. It's generous. Is this this spy show? The premise of Barry. I mean, I won't tell you anything you won't learn in the first 10 minutes of the first episode. But the premise of Barry is he's an ex marine. And he got out of the service and his life was really shitty. And then he became basically this like family friend got him into like a world of crime where he became a hitman. And he's really he's unbelievably good at killing people. He's like a super

Unknown 40:21
when he's when he's in that mode. Like he's utterly professional. And like, he just gets the shit done.

Unknown 40:27
Yeah, he's like an incredibly good Hitman. So he gets a contract from the Chechen mob in Los Angeles to kill the head of the church and mob his wife is sleeping with her fitness instructor. So they hire Barry to kill the fitness instructor. So he goes to LA and he starts tailing the fitness instructor. And the fitness instructor goes into an acting class taught by Henry Winkler, the Fonz. And he gets pulled on stage as part of this acting exercise and it changes his whole life and he decides he wants to become an actor, but he's horrible he

Unknown 40:54
rediscovers this like this like not not not just a sensitive but he discovers something about himself even in that short being an environment and being on stage he this thing that he just can't like shake Yeah, so he decides he has to become an but he's but he's but he's horrible. He's horrible at it. So the show is sort of about I mean, to me it's about what happens when like you're really good at something but it's not the thing that's good for you. Also it's got a little bit of you know, a little bit of Breaking Bad in the sense of like you know, he's not gonna there's a constant threat of people discovering one of his worlds you know, in the other world and it's just this constant sense of like, how long will it be

Unknown 41:31
well, what I thought was really smart about Breaking Bad was breaking bad had this real exploration of consequences so in other shows you kill someone and then at the end of that guy, but in Breaking Bad you have to get rid of the body and then you dissolve it in a hot bath tub of acid and then the ass Oh my god. Yeah. Right. Like that's almost the thesis of Breaking Bad is like the one thing leads to the next leads to the next and there's no thing or it's like you Oh, you killed him. And you're done. Right? You killed him and you're just getting started. And Barry really embraces that there's no nothing is clean in that show. Like everything leads to the next thing leads to the next thing in a way that I find that to be. I mean, I think that's pretty clearly borrowed from breaking bad that that storytelling idea, but I just find that to be so compelling, such compelling storytelling.

Unknown 42:14
There was a pretty good show on HBO that did that for six years. I'm Oh, there was a news for the show on HBO for the first six seasons of it thinks that consequences in meaning. So

Unknown 42:30
are you a little salty there Merlin?

Unknown 42:31
No, I'm fine. I'm still very watching I'm still watching two or three old episodes tonight. Oh wow. It's just it's frustrating. How good it's frustrating how good

Unknown 42:39
Oh, you're talking about the

Unknown 42:40
gab it's just just frustrating how fucking great that show was. And then you watch the end? No, no, it's like a community theater play. Oh, they thought they had they thought they had three hours and actually had 30 minutes anyway we got a mix of worms let's Yeah, we

Unknown 42:58
got the worms coming in coming in hot Alright, so whose challenge Alex I believe it was my channel challenge

Unknown 43:04
challenge week was to pitch the sharks and dunk

Unknown 43:15
squad Oh people may be familiar with the TV show Shark Tank on ABC. It's a they celebrated 10 years of dreams this season with

Unknown 43:28
thank you for your service. So episodes going to be about veterans with the wife that pretends to like though it's both very fit

Unknown 43:36
it was

Unknown 43:39
Veterans Day okay.

Unknown 43:42
There's a bunch of dangling and rich people and it's based on the English show Dragon's Den you go in there and you push these folks on your your business idea and they can decide whether

Unknown 43:52
to invest. Wait a minute.

Unknown 43:56
We need the intro. Trying to find it.

Unknown 44:03
Okay, hold on, hold on. Ready? Ready.

Unknown 44:05
No, I got it. Okay. Okay. There we go.

Unknown 44:14
We're still blazing a trail

Unknown 44:18
into their own hands.

Unknown 44:24
By working smart the ultimate sleep solution that stops mouth breathing and

Unknown 44:32
we're celebrating a decade of dreams.

Unknown 44:41
continues.

Unknown 44:56
Investors sharks the sharks invest their own money at their discretion. New offer is being solicited to the

Unknown 45:02
third is droopy. Bear

Unknown 45:16
was being made to solicit from the audience. Why can't they get a girlfriend

Unknown 45:21
now we cut away to another follow up of Barbara visiting the lobster brother.

Unknown 45:30
Brothers they're back Hey, now I'm in a Bed Bath and Beyond Why do you put lobsters in the trash Mr.

Unknown 45:36
Wonderful shut it out and put her fucking cups like a soda when he loves what is it funerals because people are emotional.

Unknown 45:45
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.

Unknown 45:48
Oh, you know what?

Unknown 45:50
Honestly, it's 10 years lobster place where you make your own lobster. We give you the cheese.

Unknown 46:00
People putting their hands

Unknown 46:10
on a lobster nobody's gonna stop you. He's so old.

Unknown 46:19
Lobster. I'm gonna put that on my list. That's good. Uh, so you the idea was it was it was your challenge. I was Yeah,

Unknown 46:25
it was my challenge. And the challenge was I and I kept it pretty open. I was just like, create a shark tank, prod product. Because you know who if hundreds of Americans are doing it for over 10 years? Why wouldn't we? But before before we start real quick. Are there any Shark Tank products that you use on a fairly regular basis?

Unknown 46:51
We Oh you know what we got that we it's actually according to my I'm not a consumer of this but my wife and my daughter love it are those Bantam bagels? like cream cheese? I know. They're supposed to be really good. Shut up bagel people. I don't care. I don't care about cheese sticks and bagels. I'm talking about my family. That's supposedly really good. Um, you bought dude wipes one time, didn't you? Alex and then you were using them on the wrong parts

Unknown 47:12
the well, we bought them on Amazon for a bit at one point. And then we found out that they were not only stealing valor, but they just like bought guns for fun. Like no

Unknown 47:23
fun goods.

Unknown 47:24
You know, you have to know how to do that. You can have people shoving their arms into a 600 degree. It's all supervised Jerry.

Unknown 47:36
I'm sorry. I'm gonna

Unknown 47:47
Oh my god. Looking at this list of like, the most successful products. I'm a scrub Daddy.

Unknown 47:54
Daddy. Daddy, I have I have a scrub daddy. It's pretty good.

Unknown 47:58
I use the scrub daddy almost every day.

Unknown 48:01
Really good sponge. The big selling point of the scrub daddy is that it gets when it gets hot. It's soft, kind of like a normal sponge. But when it gets cold when you put cold water on it or when you squeeze it out and it's dry, it gets hard and rigid and you can use it to scour

Unknown 48:15
the opposite of a man.

Unknown 48:16
Yes. Cool. That's nice. I love it. The I mean, we all use the ring doorbell the infamous

Unknown 48:26
I don't know why I said that. I don't know if

Unknown 48:28
that's a great product or works every time I use it. Very

Unknown 48:32
glad that guy's a millionaire.

Unknown 48:34
extremely reliable. It's just It's amazing. The convenience of being able to pop up that video stream in like milliseconds.

Unknown 48:52
Literally it worked once and it was just because my landlord was curious.

Unknown 48:57
Just like looking into it like all fish it

Unknown 49:28
our office used to squat at parties for a while and then I hope one day they all disappeared clean

Unknown 49:34
those Do you clean those regularly? Everything you do a bathroom needs to be clean.

Unknown 49:37
I did it. I didn't. I wouldn't run into my home. But I just found out that Kodiak cakes which are these like basically weird keto pancakes started on Shark Tank. I didn't know that. Yeah, they've got a bear on them. They're they're lovely. That's you know, but this is we don't have time to get into this and you guys can go make worms. But there's so much about that show. There's just such a fucking jam up.

Unknown 50:02
I mean, one of them being Of course, you never hear about the deals that don't go through it because it turns out to be just utter fraud. What a terrible way to try and get actual money for your business. There's so much about it. That's so so so stupid, but it is entertaining, partly because of the dealings it can be

Unknown 50:17
full Yeah, and now they've got the folks that clearly don't want or need money. They just exactly on the show. And I'm like OC equivalent

Unknown 50:25
of pebble being on Kickstarter. Yeah. You know what I mean? where it's like, no, you're being mainly just using this as a way to preorder. Yeah, you know, really here for support.

Unknown 50:33
I mean, I don't have a huge problem with that. I don't know why I jumped in hard courts and

Unknown 50:39
screws up the power dynamic if they don't need the money. That's the problem. I don't

Unknown 50:43
know. I ok. Take the studio meet guys. They're like okay, clearly this cat thing. Nobody wanted it. Glad we did. I did. But clearly Do you remember that the studio neat guys, we're going to create a cat laser that was basically an automated like a home automated cat laser thing and a Kickstarter, and they're like, yeah, we could have afforded to make this but we're really glad we did ends. Right. And they do the same thing with like, their expensive pens and nice paper because it's like, we don't know I

Unknown 51:14
just bought one of their notebooks or actually, I bought two of their notebooks.

Unknown 51:16
Oh, I love I love it. I love the notebook. I love the panel book, but I love the top book even more

Unknown 51:23
panel books. So cool, right? Any

Unknown 51:27
challenge challenge, Doug? Um, would how do we want to round robin this? Who should I go first?

Unknown 51:33
Alex? I feel like you're already blowing your pitch I

Unknown 51:38
confidence. I'm all right. Sharks. Has this ever happened to you? As I pull up this? No.

Unknown 51:47
This is Excuse me? This is the time where one of you supposed to say I do but I want to royalty.

Unknown 51:55
Listen, listen, listen, Miss Miss Cox. I can't understand your accent for that reason.

Unknown 52:01
It's not something I would use. And

Unknown 52:10
you know, I really I think this week, I think this would be a great fit in my, in my wedding services.

Unknown 52:18
I love to target people when they're getting married because they're irrational. so

Unknown 52:21
emotional. I love I love to come on so many different things. For that reason.

Unknown 52:27
So wise

Unknown 52:29
sharks Has this ever happened to you, you go into a hotel and in your room, you have no idea how to work the showerhead, you find yourself turning the knob left to right, then left right again, only to get mixed results. The water is either boiling hot, freezing cold or won't turn on it. Oh, there has to be a better way. Introducing I we couldn't figure out a name hotel handle job. This simply

Unknown 52:59
means that this

Unknown 53:02
was really good. But I mean, that was the first one obviously. But uh, a patent pending. And by pending. I mean, I googled how to patent something in Illinois and close that and I'm like, I'm not gonna dedicate that much to this bit. A plastic mold that just goes around your showerhead. And you might ask, how does this work? Well, well, we've programmed all of the like, it has a only the biggest moment of my life. Oh boy. It has a built in waterproof LCD screen. And you just plop this shower head on. And suddenly a PDF shows up of the shower. Instruction shower instructions. Sure I stopped taking notes at this point, and then simply and easily turn the shower to your preferred temperature sharks, who's ready to get into the shower with me? OU?

Unknown 54:02
So how does it work to set the chair temperature?

Unknown 54:05
Well, I'm glad you asked. You put on our patent pending does both design and utility patent on to the showerhead and then it knows intelligently how to turn it on. Because when

Unknown 54:27
you do this this

Unknown 54:28
challenge you do not know there's a patent pending.

Unknown 54:31
Here's the thing with

Unknown 54:33
a misunderstanding with an actual business

Unknown 54:39
or a product because buying

Unknown 54:43
What about Can I just sound like something from Harry Potter.

Unknown 54:46
Sure, hold on.

Unknown 54:48
If you got a pitch you got the right pitch.

Unknown 54:52
So okay, I

Unknown 54:54
wanted to murder someone with a spell.

Unknown 54:58
Hey, sharks. Are you tired of pants?

Unknown 55:01
Oh, boy. So everyone's game.

Unknown 55:05
I thought about this. And I was talking to some some of my friends and I who like manufacture products and I realized I could have reached out to like the people who actually manufacture like the studio neat guys are like the like Sherry or some of the people that we've worked with, but I was too embarrassed. And I'm like, this is a waste. Again, this is a waste of their time. Also, this is a real job that they have a yc but she invoice you. Yes. Okay, so you create a 3d mold that fits over any showerhead, right? One of the twisty ones, okay, okay. It's just it's you could have a rubber band, really, it's just the waterproof LCD that suction cups on to the screen that you can google the the PDF of the instructions on how to turn the shower head. That's it. And yes, those exists. And yes, I had the head to Google them. And now number of times at various hotels of various costs, you'd think that a four seasons would have a reasonable shower, you wouldn't be wrong. I don't know how to do that for some reason baths. And you might you might the question that might come up is do you have this product for baths at all? Well, here's the thing. Those are clearly labeled. No one's ever had a problem with it. Yep, there's there's true traditional bath conventions all around the world. But in America and Europe, all the shower heads are completely different.

Unknown 1:03:42
I have a friend who's in this movie.

Unknown 1:03:45
Crazy. I can, unfortunately imagine many people like there are so many people who were just you know, in a union there, they're putting up lights and then they're like, Oh, wait, wait, oh, oh, no. Oh, no. God, and God, and then they're all turning and looking at like the two black women on set. And there's

Unknown 1:04:10
any loquacious black lady reaction chips. Let's go. No. Okay. Lucretia.

Unknown 1:04:16
This is the after show. No, no, no.

Unknown 1:04:20
Okay, thank you ready for coming to you by Friday? Good.

Unknown 1:04:27
Friday, buttering No, no, no, no, no, I'm there don't seem to be any look,

Unknown 1:04:32
you know, I'll let me tell you something, though. I did this. We're short on time. So we could cut out.

Unknown 1:04:36
I did a I did an actual business. Oh, that was

Unknown 1:04:42
okay. Yeah.

Unknown 1:04:45
I did this wrong. The problem is that I, I was talking to Veronica and how hard it was for me to do this. And the problem is, anytime I come up with a funny idea for a business actually do it.

Unknown 1:04:54
Wait a minute, you actually made an actual business?

Unknown 1:04:57
No, no, I came up with a really fucking good, isn't it? Okay, we should actually give me money to do

Unknown 1:05:02
matching. And I were like, there's a 6% chance that max actually creates an LLC, or like,

Unknown 1:05:11
not enough time to do that.

Unknown 1:05:12
No other farts and post your hearts. How is that not a money making machine?

Unknown 1:05:18
It's pretty good. Well, here's, here's the business I came up with. I have this idea that I think we should take like abandoned warehouses and industrial buildings like you could go on in like, unlike like, Avondale and Chicago, there's a lot of sort of abandoned warehouse buildings, you buy them pretty cheap, okay, buildings need a ton of work. So you're gonna pull the roof off. And you replace it with like a glass roof. And you're going to turn the entire building into a huge city block sized greenhouse. And inside you're going to like larger format. And you're going to make like hills and trees and groves and cool area upon like, Cool area is to sit on there's going to be like bugs and it's going to be like a whole real ass for season outdoor thing. And it's a co working space. And it's a membership model. And people pay and you come to work in the park and there's like hidden power outlets, there's, they'll be really good Wi Fi. And there's like a membership model.

Unknown 1:06:21
Because of gentrification, I'm gonna have to be

Unknown 1:06:26
there's no way you could do it. This is

Unknown 1:06:28
this is that we know do you replace the replace the roof, so it's still it's still temperature controlled. This is

Unknown 1:06:35
our season in Chicago, because it gets real depressing in Chicago when you can't sort of lie in the grass for six months. I don't like that about Chicago.

Unknown 1:06:44
I mean, so you dig deep enough,

Unknown 1:06:46
you could but but I go to like, you know, I'll go to like, like Garfield Park conservatory or something like that. And I just think there should be something like that where you can pay a little bit or be a member and then you go in and you just lie on the grass with your laptop and do some work.

Unknown 1:06:58
It's like we just like we work but good. not crazy.

Unknown 1:07:00
Well, the sense that you're not there. You wouldn't go there every day for meetings to run your company. It's more like a coffee shop like you would

Unknown 1:07:07
Oh yes,

Unknown 1:07:09
you'd go for a few hours and people you go for a walk with someone that kind of a thing.

Unknown 1:07:14
I think that's not a bad idea. I'm interested in in the wasn't when you go ahead, Alex, what we gonna say?

Unknown 1:07:19
I This isn't a real bit. How would how in any How?

Unknown 1:07:28
shower PDF generator,

Unknown 1:07:30
PDF, like your

Unknown 1:07:33
shower in a moment?

Unknown 1:07:36
I'm not saying that it's more likely that mine will be successful. Like, how would would you just have to get a bunch of VC funding? Let's say you're not need like,

Unknown 1:07:46
I need like probably $4 million to do this. And I think you can easily make that back on on a membership model. Plus, like, well, it's like you don't like coffee shops, you do wedding rentals during the weekends and things like that.

Unknown 1:07:59
I love it. Love weddings. That's when I started my cupcakes also funeral.

Unknown 1:08:02
Yeah, but you have some real expensive sort of

Unknown 1:08:06
rental venue. You do corporate team building and shit in there. You do buyouts you do private events. You could have like a band shall have concerts at night.

Unknown 1:08:14
I feel like this. Absolutely. Like it does mean. But But well, not in the not in the CO working sort of like I mean, why not just donate $4 million to a public park? I mean, I know. I mean. I know.

Unknown 1:08:31
And that's, you're asking me for that. Yes, my money to give them money.

Unknown 1:08:35
Here's the problem. Merlin, please say anything good about this idea. Somehow, it's gonna happen. I'm not gonna have a job anymore. And then my job will be digging a hole.

Unknown 1:08:44
Next, take off your headphones, Alex and I need to take a few minutes. I'm

Unknown 1:08:47
gonna I'm gonna be just you know, in mulch all the time. I don't know,

Unknown 1:08:52
Max. I mean, I love the idea of it. But I'm not sure about the practicality do people put their hands into the oven?

Unknown 1:08:59
Actually, what is interesting about putting, like, there's so much like mixed up and conflicting research about how much solar panels are like, will actually help cities. But I wonder if Mm Hmm, I don't know. Now I'm thinking about the reality of it.

Unknown 1:09:19
Why only thing we can think about is parking is parking

Unknown 1:09:22
the purple? Well, people in Chicago, like there's two classes of people in Chicago, the people who park in the people who don't and I don't even mean that by like wealth. It's just some people have had cars forever, and they still have them. And then there's people who walk everywhere or take public transit. Right. So I like that's an issue with any space although because it's in Avondale, which is a far north neighborhood of Chicago. And it's kind of being like, it's not it's kind of one of those things where it's already gentrified. So it's not like Logan Square, which is a Western neighborhood of Chicago. Um, there's there are just like empty lots and it's it's it's a bummer to go around there. I'd take the what would it be called Max?

Unknown 1:10:14
That's a good question. Like I'm solar punk.

Unknown 1:10:21
Solar punk.

Unknown 1:10:22
Solar. Solar.

Unknown 1:10:26
