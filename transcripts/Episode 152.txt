Unknown 2:43
What he thinks is the handle, which Cameron is trying now.

Unknown 2:47
Well, he he sent he was before all this started. He'd sent me a thing to say earlier that he was on Skype. And he sent that from Skype. So let me go look and see if I can find that in my history. But what's his name? Oh, this is the terrible app. Man. Okay, so where do I find this information? Oh, wait. Oh, here he is. Hello. Oh, there he is. Okay, so that that's okay. That's not actually his handle.

Unknown 3:19
The internet is so bad here on Skype.

Unknown 3:22
Uh, well, we couldn't find max on Skype. But you found max on Skype. So we're all good. And we're trying to find max gave us a false flag. I think

Unknown 3:30
you sent us the wrong handle. Yeah,

Unknown 3:32
we I've got many Skype handles.

Unknown 3:34
I couldn't I couldn't. So what happened was Skype kept making me like login and two factor authentication into my account over and over. After a long arduous journey, I was able to eventually successfully login to Skype, but then it wasn't my normal handle. So I don't know. Maybe I've been hacked. Or I might have been hacked. Again.

Unknown 3:53
We've been shadow van wide open to talking to us.

Unknown 3:55
Oh, no. We could call TIFF

Unknown 3:58
Yeah,

Unknown 3:58
I don't know that Marco was one have experienced in this kind of, you know, creative project. Amy's probably got to get a lot of stuff plugged in.

Unknown 4:07
Right headphones. Do we know that he owns a nice microphone.

I think at least one. I don't

Unknown 4:13
want him to talk right into his MacBook Pro once I'm good

Unknown 4:16
orientation week 886. I was talking to a woman in a Bray at my college woman my age, and she and we're talking and she's talking a lot about art. And I said, Oh wow, you should really know a lot about you know, you know, 19th century French painters and 20 century French painters, or European painters and she she hadn't yet beginner's mind. And then I said are you an artist? She says no, I'm more of an artist. And I still don't know what that means. But I think what

Unknown 4:44
you just need like I'm like I'm Madeline cookie. What happened?

Unknown 4:47
What happened? I think

Unknown 4:50
Bill the TR my Madeline

Unknown 4:54
the i think i think what she said I feel like what she might I might have done a follow up question. It was a long time ago, but I feel like what she's trying to say is she's not a producer of fine art, but she's an appreciator. What I'm trying to say to you is maybe that's Marcos thing. That's his secret. He's an artist all along. Maybe he doesn't need the microphones and headphones but he's super interested and then he sends them all back. He doesn't Hurley full Hurley Can we show it? Should we tweet?

Unknown 5:20

Unknown 11:38
sending it people kept sending it to me too. They kept winking at me

Unknown 11:44
I don't I don't know

Unknown 11:45
if we're going to interrupt the interruption to the interruption to the to the say the story max what what is it our friend Marco did

Unknown 11:51
um I have actually would love to get into this for a minute because I am so confused about the decision making tree that led to the state of fear but Marco was staying in an okay so I want to say that we know from the story that Ergo told that it was a nice hotel. It was a fancy hotel and he needed to make coffee for some reason but there was no means to make coffee and so he took the hotel iron which quote looked clean and then then made the hot water and the Iran

Unknown 12:20
new it looks brand new.

Unknown 12:22
It looks brand new and then heated the water less

Unknown 12:25
clean then

Unknown 12:27
in the hotel iron and then made like I was at a Starbucks via

Unknown 12:30
no it was a swift cup my preferred instant coffee but it's a similar kind of thing. You don't have fancy instant coffee.

Unknown 12:36
Why did I have so many questions but and

Unknown 12:38
to clarify like I didn't put the instant coffee into the iron

Unknown 12:42
you know that you can get coffee at a hotel?

Unknown 12:44
Yes, I do. See here's the thing so you know in most hotel rooms it wouldn't be a problem most hotel rooms have a kettle or something you can make hot water with worse than the iron though. I'm a straight up kettle I'm not sure if it's like a full coffeemaker those are often pretty gross but like a straight up kettle I don't think it's too bad because you can see see all the surfaces and you know you can kind of Judge there well it was like you know a regular drip coffeemaker you know you can't really see where all that water's going and on the inside and everything anyway, so I needed a way to heat water and these this hotel was fancy enough that they don't even have coffee makers in the rooms because they want you to go downstairs to the casino and buy coffee there and and

Unknown 13:21
so that's the thing is like you try and get like a fucking like a Marianne you're like can I please like I might want to go down to the pantry. Love the pantry. But can I please have a refrigerator? Right? Yeah, and he thing other places are like oh no sorrow, the road noise machines will have the man bring ice to you. I'm like, I don't want the man to bring it to me. It's part of my ritual.

Unknown 13:39
There's no ice machines in these hotels. There's no like refrigerator space except for except for the minis. I know exactly. Exactly what you're talking about. Yeah. So So and I want to call things we have just gotten there was like we just flown in. So I had some jet lag. It was late. I wanted some coffee to keep me up. I didn't want to go downstairs to get the shitty coffee at the bottom because the thing is the law of hot places places that have hot always have the shiniest coffee. So this was this was Las Vegas and it just it totally holds up there. So I mean like it's like it gets worse as you get further south like Arizona is the worst. But like you know lots of not good coffee there you know your best bet is go downstairs get an espresso because the floor of how bad espresso can be is much higher than the floor of how bad drip coffee can be. So that's always my rule like when I'm traveling I just stick with espresso because it's going to be less bad than everything else I can get. But when I have my fancy instant coffee, all I need is a way to make some hot water and I can have good coffee. So that's what I chose to do and there happened to be an appliance in the room that could make hot water

Unknown 14:40
certainly never utilized by a lonely German

Unknown 14:42
no and I had I had a travel mug to to brew it in so all I needed was something to make hot water and pour it into my travel mug and the water from the tap wasn't hot enough so I started with tap water I poured it in and you know let the iron heated up for a long time on like this Supermax steam cycle and then dumped into my travel mug and it was glorious.

Unknown 15:02
Mirko you do I think you do well in prison you'd be one of those guys who hooks up like a nine volt battery to the to the hair iron to like turn your

Unknown 15:11
artists handle toilet water Doritos

Unknown 15:13
like a like a ramen noodle or something.

Unknown 15:19
If it gets hot enough it's going to disinfect it right? This is why we need Dr. Dawn but if he's heating that's what

Unknown 15:25
I thought well it turns out Dr. Don weighed in on this and our private Slack channel and he vindicated me he said that that sounded like a low risk see this is this is an inquiry increasingly have a problem with Dr. Don

Unknown 15:40
doesn't seem like he's a man. He's he he says he's a doctor. He seems like somebody that we could trust and he

Unknown 15:45
turns out or like

Unknown 15:47
it depends now it doesn't depend a German came in that

Unknown 15:53
place.

Unknown 15:54
That's for German come and blue shirts, Jesus.

Unknown 16:00
Doctor anymore now you're Mr. Dawn I just

Unknown 16:01
why is it that whenever I asked Dr. Don if it's like safe to eat bananas, he always goes, Oh, well, we haven't done studies on that. And I don't know the risk factors and there's certain percentages of this and that and Mark was like can I make Can I cook in my hotel iron? He's like, Oh, absolutely. That's fine. That's great. We love We love to see it.

Unknown 16:21
Anyway, thanks for coming on the show.

Unknown 16:38
Look at the storm troopers.

Unknown 16:39
Yeah, I went to so I may not so I this week. I am in the wonderful city of Orlando, Florida, where everything is a very sticky and moldy

Unknown 16:49
don't get coffee there.

Unknown 16:51
Did you know what so far the law of hot places and holds up quite well? I don't know where we go.

Unknown 16:57
There we go. Disney here Wi Fi. Okay.

Unknown 17:02
Really don't get Wi Fi there either. Can you hear me? There we are

Unknown 17:09
back. We're back. Yeah. Oh, this is so cool. I love it. So I was able to replicate the law of hot weather repeatedly on this trip already. But I'm here for I'm here for a the genie convention which is a genie magazine's annual magic convention and it was kind of a last minute trip. And I got it. We got it here with a friend of the show. Jordan we got in yesterday. And we had a little bit of free time. So we just sort of happened to we just went to Disney we were like we have some time we're in Orlando Let's go. And we we strolled into Epcot. Because that's kind of the coolest proprietary park in in Orlando. And it turns out that we were there on like a huge Epcot day. Because it was the food and wine week it's food Wine Festival, which is delightful. But it was also the first ever perfect performance that evening of the new light show over the lake which is called Epcot forever and we just have not planned I'm not like a Disney blogger now but like we just happen to be there and also I believe that the new thing that which is the the gondolas that connects all the parks it just I think it opened this weekend and we went on it yes it did.

Unknown 18:19
Yes, it did.

Unknown 18:21
Like a sky ride.

Unknown 18:22
Yes, it is. So it is so fucking cool. It is total Disney magic and moves so fast. The views are awesome. It's It is like such a futuristic like it really. It feels like old school Disney. It's like cool transit. You know, I love it. I

Unknown 18:38
love to be the best way that when I was when I was a kid and we go to Orlando when there was only the Magic Kingdom. Back then was the 1920s Yeah, there's a sky lot of the sky way. It was called sky way to tomorrow and sky way to Fantasyland and you could basically do a diagonal across the park in the air and it was so freaking fun and fast. It's the best way it's the only way to fly.

Unknown 18:58
So yeah, we were walking around Epcot yesterday. And we were like, you know what be cool is is we had sort of exhausted the stuff to do at Epcot. And we were like, you know, it'd be cool if we could go to Star Wars land for one hour and then come back to see the light show. And we were like, but how are we going to get there in time and we happen to realize that this thing had just opened we jumped on it it was eight miles in like five minutes. It was so fast. It was so cool. And so we get we went over to MGM we saw Star Wars for a little bit. Star Wars fucking rolled I did not get enough time to like fully take everything in but but

Unknown 19:33
what was this the new thing? I'm kind of confused. I'm confused max. Is this where you can like wait in line and then like five Millennium Falcon. You get the Blue Moon? Yeah,

Unknown 19:40
yeah, it's that whole world. It's in Florida at the open in Florida

Unknown 19:44
is the good one. The good one at Disney World. Allegedly they're basically the

Unknown 19:49
same, but

Unknown 19:50
they also have the avatar there or is that

Unknown 19:52
that is also in Orlando. Yeah, yeah. So my star I can't believe people are complaining about Star Wars. It's one of the coolest things I've ever seen in my entire life. My jaw was on the floor. I was filled with like a sense of childhood. childlike wonder. It was amazing. Like we should go we should all do a vacation go to Star Wars land together. And then number two, the other funny thing was like so they had so they had the new light show. And it was it's one it was so fucking cool. Like, I was like, jumping up and down. I was so excited by the like the fireworks show. And it was very nostalgic. And it had like music from all the old Epcot stuff that they're tearing down. And afterwards you know we were surrounded by like it was the park was packed and we were surrounded by like Disney bloggers and people you know, there's like a whole cottage industry of people who like you know, they like film and photograph and live stream all the new whatever's new at Disney. I don't know if you guys are aware of this world.

Unknown 20:43
Oh, just a little bit. Yeah. sounds horrible.

Unknown 20:46
Oh, yeah. I mean, like, it's just if you watch one default plan that's going to be your recommendations forever. Like there's so many like immersive, immersive, Disney. I'm not I'm not trying to throw shade but like yes, you're absolutely right. There's like this whole at least on YouTube with my few poured into it. There's like this whole cottage industry of people reporting on aspects of theme parks in general Disney in particular victim getting extremely specific. There's like I think there's like Haunted Mansion bloggers like they really get into it.

Unknown 21:13
Yeah, it's it's a whole it's a thing and and they were all there. I mean, it was a big to do and it was packed. And I saw this thing. And I was so I mean, I was like, I was like shooting my pants. It was the coolest thing I've ever seen. And then afterwards, just out of curiosity, I went on Twitter, and I did a search for hashtag Epcot. Because I was just like, I wonder what people are saying about that. And everyone was nitpicking and all I I didn't like it. It was not it wasn't as good as the old firework show. And I was like, You're out of your fucking mind. If you didn't think that's the coolest thing you've ever seen. They had. They had these huge kites flying and tight formation over the water being pulled by jet skis that were like running dark. So you couldn't even see that there were jet skis and the kites were launching fireworks out of their tails like it was it all choreographed to music and Walt Disney speaking like I like what more do you want? Like what do you what do you people want?

Unknown 22:09
I don't know what you what answer you want from from this? I don't know it was it was sofas very frustrating.

Unknown 22:16
Objectively Star Wars fans are the worst. And I think they just kind of said, I don't think you should speak ill of the Disney weirdos who live stream and Periscope from let's say the the the Magic Castle premieres but but the Star Wars people are just pitching the same way they went about Ryan Johnson so I just don't listen. Don't listen to them and we'll just make you sad and just go and enjoy the fancy Dasani water bottles.

Unknown 22:46
I did get a fancy Dasani water bottle good good i'm glad and I got it and i a Toronto rap. Oh,

Unknown 22:53
okay. No, God this is the worst audience

Unknown 22:56
get them did you get a magic? No, no, we I am I don't want to brag but I am a Disney annual pass holder so that means I can I have a little credit card and I can just use that to stroll into the park whenever I want and I don't need I don't need to see

Unknown 23:10
didn't want to brag is that we

Unknown 23:14
just have fun just a fun fact about

Unknown 23:15
you only have like a pen that hundred a very you know less than 100 people in the world have no big deal no big deal. All right now that Max has triggered me. How are you doing? So

Unknown 23:29
I was just zoning out during all the Disney talk Yeah. Once I went survivor next

Unknown 23:38
political Twitter This is all my favorite top oh my gosh,

Unknown 23:40
you guys have so much to say. Macro coming soon

Unknown 23:47
yeah, yeah, I it's it's excited to we hang on so are you down into theme park stuff at all? You have a youngster Do you have you been if you heard the siren song of fun theme park stuff enjoy? Because it is kind of fun to take a little kid there. I we haven't tried yet. And not necessarily not necessarily to Disney. Like our first our first theme park was Lego Land and was actually like a good starter theme park.

Unknown 24:12
Yeah, we haven't tried a whole lot yet because like he doesn't like our son doesn't really get super into like certain characters or anything. So like we don't we don't really have much of a draw there. But I don't know we should give it a try.

Unknown 24:22
The whole Disney thing can be a little overwhelming and certainly costly. But

Unknown 24:26
I gotta say like every every description I've ever heard of what it's like to go to Disney from all of you on podcasts. Sounds like something that we would not enjoy.

Unknown 24:35
Yeah, I think that's the problem is you are the only person I know in my immediate like tech world that sort of like understands beaches and understands why they're shut up Berlin like I

Unknown 24:51
understand he's gonna go It's hot

Unknown 24:54
water and Marco I was with you. I don't want to swim. I don't want sand. I don't want sun. I want everyone to be silent in air conditioning. That's a vacation how

Unknown 25:03
much beach Can you really do i mean you should you go there you look at it. What are you gonna read for a little bit and then you're done. It's like watching YouTube video the beach.

Unknown 25:11
What? What what I get out of the beach is not just being in the sun on the sand and in the water itself. When you're new the beach, the air is different, the climate is different, the people are different. And so I actually just enjoy being in the beach town. Like I like living at the beach for a few weeks or a month or two months where I liked that is way different than taking a day trip to the beach to be on the sand like that. I don't enjoy that very much either. When I'm at the beach I'm hardly ever on the beach. I'm

Unknown 25:41
proud of you for swimming. I was really proud of you for swimming I was really glad to hear that that's really cool that you did that that took guts

Unknown 25:46
thank you yeah it's a it was a thing it

Unknown 25:48
does it does I mean like it's it's a horrible it's a it's a horrible Nemesis to see it once

Unknown 25:55
Yes It sure does.

Unknown 25:56
Do you ever go in a body of water and you're swimming and like a little UCV touches your foot

Unknown 26:02
and then you think you're going to die that's that's a yearly occurrence yeah

Unknown 26:05
what is what is that a giant a giant squid? What is that

Unknown 26:10
it's another one of these like so like maybe a beaches and like a theme park are our sort of like, counterparts were like for me like the idea of going somewhere and like you pay way too much for hotel room but then it's like your steps away from walking into the park and you get in early and it's like that's my it's the Mandatory Fun of Oh, but beaches are great. And it's like No, they're not. It's a hellscape Do you have any idea how many second degree burns I've gotten from that giant busted ass star? I'm all fucked up from sun I live in Florida. I spent my entire youth carrying two to three shirts with me at all times. is heat fun. No it is not and sand is bad and it gets on your Johnson get away.

Unknown 26:52
Oh terrible don't get

Unknown 26:54
you don't get to what? You don't get pockets. I have to go sit on sand in the heat

Unknown 26:59
you no no I have a permanent pocket the door you have a Johnson so.

Unknown 27:22
So thanks for coming on. Sorry, we had the

Unknown 27:26
permanent pocket. That's a horrible.

Unknown 27:30
It's true.

Unknown 27:32
I'm sorry. I had to move my quiet keyboard because I'm photographing knives.

Unknown 27:35
Hmm. Yeah, I've been I've been doing that. I'm trying to get somebody to I don't have an intern now. So I know it's life is very hard to chat Jeff to

Unknown 27:43
return it.

Unknown 27:44
I did. I did. I had to drive.

Unknown 27:48
Here you go.

Unknown 27:50
In turn for what

Unknown 27:54
we do anyway. Oh, entry. If you head out get some thought.

Unknown 27:58
How often do you order? I shouldn't say how do you care? Why do

Unknown 28:03
you care what I eat? Why does that matter? Why

Unknown 28:05
no, no, no, no, no. I'm curious how often you order your food before we've ended the show, but also how far we get into the show before you order the food or any type of food. If you if you're genuinely curious, I

Unknown 28:19
will tell you sometimes I will read when I suspect we're into or beginning the after show. And I mean like without compromising my upset. My arrangements have changed a little bit to where I don't have to do as much super time to pick up in the afternoon. So I do have more time. But as I get hungry because I'm not a morning eater. I wish I were a morning eater. I want to become a high protein morning eater to project that I still haven't arrived. I need easy morning protein, eggs, then you make a pan then you make a pan you gotta clean you gotta clean the pan, you know,

Unknown 28:49
but it's not like you can get like a decent nonstick pan for no money and

Unknown 28:55
your company goes

Unknown 28:57
non stick pans are not a thing that needs to be expensive. The expensive ones are not actually better they don't actually last longer. So you can just get like five cheap ones. And like when this one one starts becoming a stick pan you throw it away you get the next one.

Unknown 29:11
Yeah, we got a ceramic California Merlin is

Unknown 29:13
the issue that you don't you don't know what to make for breakfast or you don't have the right gadgets or whatever or is the issue that you wake up and you're not hungry.

Unknown 29:20
very uncomfortable with this becoming about my proteins. My morning.

Unknown 29:23
What Why don't use the that that egg tube external thing. Yeah,

Unknown 29:26
that's it. Yeah, yeah. I have so many things that have come to me through this show that are just they're just so challenging to have in the house. I could do that. I could do that. I could also see I try to avoid the one the super boring. My thing is I learned a long time ago, when I pretty easily drop 20 pounds on Atkins, that land improve my health. I learned a long time ago. The carbohydrates are my friend me I need to be very careful with carbohydrates because they harm my health and they make me feel sad. And so like I like a high protein thing, but I live in this new neighborhood where like I want to be able to walk in somewhere and say like, could you produce from a large piece of ham with an egg on it and I'll just eat that while I walk down the street like a weirdo or read my segway let's be honest, and like but everything's bread and bread and bread. No rice noodles. I can I'll fuck with some rice noodles. But like I don't like to go too crazy with the easy breads and that's my problem because my family enjoys an easy bread and it's a very carb centric thing.

Unknown 30:22
No, I'm totally with you on low carb stuff, which is why eggs are the answer it breakfast is the easiest

Unknown 30:27
meal to fix this way. Okay, okay, so it would

Unknown 30:30
help if I had to spend money. It would help if you made me or caused me to buy a pan so before we

Unknown 30:36
buy five cheap nonstick bands, mega file

Unknown 30:39
this is why Merlin I can't believe you've been doing my egg salad challenge all these weeks week after week. I just

Unknown 30:45
keep asking you to do the egg salad is not eggs. That's oh my goodness, just adding salad to over so I

Unknown 30:50
have to admit I actually just heard that because I am two episodes behind on this podcast which I was going to fix before we record on our scheduled day Alex

Unknown 30:58
but I am totally up for the egg salad challenge. Oh

Unknown 31:02
wow we owe you one we should come back for that.

Unknown 31:06
Marco and I should just do our own we should do our own show where every week we make and review a new egg salad

Unknown 31:17
Can I pitch you might Mark I'm not sure that you saw this Can I pitch you my podcast idea? Absolutely. I have a good show for me and you to do so here's the deal so you said on our super secret channel some time ago that it actually that the fuck What was that? It was that the length of us bc cable that you own affects the charging of your device?

Unknown 31:38
I don't think I said that. That was me because that's not actually true.

Unknown 31:42
Maybe it was something you said some Did you say something about us bc Didn't you say the what the six foot cable charter girth? The girth?

Unknown 31:49
Yeah. Oh the circumference well the cables all have a maximum power waters now what's interesting is that Apple's USB see to see quote charging cables which are only us be two point O speed. seem to have no maximum power draw. Like you can charge I've tried this. I can charge my laptop at full 60 watts. It's a 39 full 60 watts over Apple's skinny little USB charge cable. So I just have a bunch of those now.

Unknown 32:14
Yeah. Okay. Here's the if it gets warmer. Okay, fine, Max. It doesn't. Yeah, right. It's it's dark magic. All right. salads. All right.

Unknown 32:22
No, no. So listen, here's my podcast. Here's my podcast idea. So I think that there's I don't know anything about cables. I buy them at random. And I have no idea what affects me and what doesn't affect me. So I think we should start up a podcast just every week where you explain one thing about one type of cable and it's like five minutes long every week. Every week we take a new kind of cable and we're like HDMI cables like, what do I need to know go? And I've already I already have a title for the show. It's called cable news with Marco. Armin. Yeah,

Unknown 32:49
yes, that is good. That we have to do

Unknown 32:55
a good podcast and it's it's literally just about cables. And it's like, it doesn't even have to be right we could just do it when there's news about cables.

Unknown 33:03
So frequent always

Unknown 33:04
news about cables like our big thing is we review we go we like wait in line, we're in the Apple Store Day one to buy all the new cables.

Unknown 33:13
Good. It also could it could also involve like, like, I'm just this is your show. But one thing would interest me also is like, like HDMI thing that that's huge. Because, like will this handle like super Blu Ray? Like there's and what will this work with? And there's all that kind of stuff? and the like, for example, but then also stuff like Could it be like Donald's and pseudo dongles, because I bought me some of those little l adapters that like let you not have your HDMI coming straight off the side of the TV. Like stuff like that. Were like make your life better for $10 You know, I'm talking about you buy these things. Yeah,

Unknown 33:49
totally. By buying allowing yourself to buy exactly the best cable for each thing you need a cable for is one of life's great undiscovered pleasures for most people.

Unknown 33:59
See, this is the show rights. writes itself. That the intro we have some computer we have some bleep bleep music. It's voice cable.

Unknown 34:14
We have at least two or three listeners

Unknown 34:17
we get Alex at least maybe

Unknown 34:22
Marco check this out sponsored by monster cable.

Unknown 34:26
No, but they're the worst. No, we gotta get the goal. The problem get the goal should be sponsored by like Mondo price.

Unknown 34:33
Oh my god, this is such a good idea. This is never gonna have a better idea than this.

Unknown 34:40
I hope that's not true.

Unknown 35:04
My My lady, my lady. So this is this is how I this is my version of that. So yes, first of all, I don't want to talk too much about this. It's like complaining about your housekeeper. But the but I do have a separate set of everything for everything. So I haven't like we talked to you talking about in your show. And it's Yeah,

Unknown 35:22
that's step one. Step one is like allowing yourself to have more cables than you think you need so that you can stash them in place.

Unknown 35:28
I don't buy Claritin. Don't buy Claritin after you've run out by before you run it right that's life man to two is one one is none by funding this means smart stuff. I have so much smart stuff still in a box I have a banker's box full of unopened smart devices as as as tests and as backups and because they came in multiples and yeah, I got more tiles than I need for now. But like my lady her taps which are few taps, which wasn't working I was like not a problem. I'm shocked

Unknown 35:58
my dad I grabbed this banker's

Unknown 36:00
box like four minutes I installed a brand new tap switch that I had

Unknown 36:06
she wasn't that

Unknown 36:08
I guess I'm feeling I'm feeling real down on smart home stuff right now like it like I've had all this stuff I you know I have multiple different systems I have you know, home kit I have I have Amazon dingus I have had from light bulbs. I have Philips Hue and why effects and I have smart we most switches and all this stuff. And it's all varying degrees of garbage. Like all of I haven't done the whole max thing with the cassette, I think

Unknown 36:32
they're all terrible in different ways. And they don't work together. It's the worst of every world

Unknown 36:35
as well. And the worst thing is they do work for like a few weeks, and then something changes. And they bro you

Unknown 36:42
mean you're talking about like build quality like Bill? No,

Unknown 36:44
no, I'm talking about just like, the software loses track of itself, or it stops responding to commands or it loses the integration with home kit or something like there's like, there's always the littlest things, just break your setup. It's such that, you know, you form such fragile setups with these things. And then oh, now my house doesn't work like it. It just drives me nuts. Like, every single day. Like I now have enough smart home stuff that every single day, something about it fails.

Unknown 37:10
So I have so the one good thing that I figured out is the loo Tron radio Ratu system, which I had, like professionally installed in my house. And I will say that thing has 100% uptime. It's been probably about one year and it has never not worked like I have it all on home kit. It works with my Syria balls. Like I Veronica is occasionally frustrated by it. But we were staying in a hotel. I'll say this though, we were staying in a hotel recently. And she we were trying to go to sleep and she told Siri to turn the lights off. And I was like, great, great victory. I was like you didn't even know that we don't have that in the hotel room. But

Unknown 37:48
so great, you successfully

Unknown 37:53
reliable and the only broken inside like me, only problem is occasionally I need to

Unknown 37:57
add a new light switch or just change something in the house or whatever. And I am so cooked by the system, I can't change anything myself. Like I have to call this

Unknown 38:09
like hire the technician

Unknown 38:10
Yes, the guy the guy has to come after call the company to come out. And he they send some chat out and he comes in with his chisel jaw line and he cooks as 1998 Dell, you know tough book up in it, he goes into the command line starts, starts tapping away at it and somehow makes all my lights talk to each

Unknown 38:28
other, all your bitcoins.

Unknown 38:33
And I, I I'm so caught by the system like I can't, I can't I can't fix it or change it by myself. I don't like that at all.

Unknown 38:41
Like what it to me like the whole appeal of the Smart Home stuff is you can get these little niceties that every every day you use it and it automates itself and you save yourself some time it's really pleasant and that that builds up over time and it's worth the hassle. But then the problem and that it truly feels that way for like the first few weeks or months that you have it. And then I'm unfortunately things are breaking or changing or software updates break things or God knows what else Apple breaks and who knows what. And then all that built up surplus of niceness and delight and save time gets eroded very quickly. And like now I'm just like, I just hate everything I want to undo all of it and to make everything dumb. It's the

Unknown 39:17
drafts of home appliances and that it's true.

Unknown 39:21
It's true purpose is not to save you time writing notes. But to give you a thing that you can configure know how

Unknown 39:29
you should switch over to the bare of smart home where you get a picture of an Alexa

Unknown 39:34
PDF you look at it

Unknown 39:36
almost like a regular writing program. Here's the other thing is that is that what sucks is things breaking you don't know like, and this is like always an ongoing bitch for me with like when we talk about some back to work is like when things silently stop working. Like oh, you forgot to do the firmware and accept the EULA update or something. And something that's like this is dumb to other people. But important to me is I do a lot of quarter vacation and tracking of stuff. And just find out that a month ago it stopped working is really frustrating. There's also the stuff where it's just a lot of what I appreciate about this is getting to where and again stuff like the heat maps, which can be a game changer with this like. Now, Alex, we've talked in I've joked about you living in the house where you have to yell at your lamps. Having a tap switch in every room changes everything if you're a huge family. And that's so great stuff like that. But then you eventually now you now you're now you're fucking cocked because now I'm all about sensors. I want sensors and location, and location to give me the Jetsons home. And you know what, I'll get just close enough that I started to believe in the Lord. And then guess what, suddenly my Canary is turned on. And there's my dick. Because the geo fence is too close to this other geo fence and the triangulation of these two things doesn't work. And now I'm screaming and everything and it can't work because guess what motion has been detected heat above 71 What is happening? And it's like I that's where it becomes these are all these different islands. You're hopping between these islands and it feels really convenient till the day that it doesn't work. And it's like that's where that's where it gets like crazy frustrating or like, like like Jason Snell talking the other day about you know I got these going to August Smart Lock and but but the Bluetooth won't work on work with his phone. But it doesn't work with his watch. So he has these great you know, smart home locks but like if you're if you're still having to like think every time you leave the house Do I have the right mix is not a criticism of Jason This is my fucking life. Do I have the right mix of stuff that this will continue to work and do what it needs to in my absence and or other people's presence? And then it's not fun anymore. Now you're living in a Jetsons hellscape

Unknown 41:46
Yeah, and I've honestly found like, I think 99% of the value I get out of all the Smart Home stuff I do so far could have also just been done by one of those like 70s Timer outlets which is just has like a two big dials and you set like what our should this turn on and turn off like that is that is like the vast majority of value I've gotten out of this and everything else has been head. Okay,

Unknown 42:07
but could they could the 70s dial make a cardboard cutout of Michael Jackson dance in your window in case there's like a burglar?

Unknown 42:13
Yes, he was put on a turntable? Yes.

Unknown 42:30
Let's do let's do our stuff.

Unknown 42:32
Challenge challenge challenge. All right, well, this week's challenge I've been gunning for this challenge for quite a while. And this is to sort of mini topics that I don't know that that individually they could sort of carry their own challenge. But together I put a point of order

Unknown 42:49
one of order can I suggest we cover the Marco related primary part in this program? And then we could move to daddy and his blades in the app. Okay, well

Unknown 42:59
well the challenge this the challenge

Unknown 43:01
this week daddy daddy in the blades

Unknown 43:03
challenges week is daddy and the blades. It's it's the knives and flashlights round up. Because this is a little sub topic that we all we all sort of for no real reason. We just collect these knives and flashlights and we're always talking about them, preparing them and I just

Unknown 43:18
I have a whole set

Unknown 43:22
there's none of us have any reason in our lives why we need either of these items, but they're just so fun that they're just so fun to collect. And so and I know Martin Marco has a depth of knowledge and flashlights, that's kind of astounding he was going into the way I'm sure we'll hear about it but there's like something with the wattage of the batteries to make it better. I don't

Unknown 43:43
know what everyone wants to hear about my God.

Unknown 43:44
I only know one of these models in this photo. I'm so excited to learn about the the whole extended Phoenix family.

Unknown 43:52
And then and then Merlin Scott, Merlin and then maybe in the after show what we'll do a little knife round up because we all have quite a few knives small.

Unknown 44:01
Got a few in front of you right now.

Unknown 44:04
I will be able to give you advice that will cost you a lot of money and get you arrested on the Chicago Public transit. So

Unknown 44:10
yeah, are we allowed to talk about this in the state of Illinois?

Unknown 44:13
As long as I just don't bring them on public Trent it's one of those it's it's honestly it's the Castle

Unknown 44:19
Doctrine. What about the standard ground

Unknown 44:23
Admiralty law?

Unknown 44:24
Is there some way you're allowed to care if you're allowed to carry an oversized knife?

Unknown 44:31
Gentlemen, I hope you're enjoying the ride for inch now.

Unknown 44:35
Here's the thing with with both knives and flashlights for me is like I always had this funny circumstance that would happen in college, which was we were always trying to smoke weed. And in order to smoke we need three things you need the you need the actual marijuana itself, you need some sort of implement, like a rolling paper or a pipe and then you need like a like a lighter or some or match or some some way to get fire. And somehow we'd always wind up with two of the three like you'd have 12 people trying to smoke weed together and you couldn't between the 12 of you cobbled together the three ingredients right to like something would always be missing like you'd have the fire and the weed but no Rolling Papers or whatever. And it was always like a catastrophe like we were oh it was so like bumbling and incompetent and as an adult This is how I feel with knives and flashlights. I always need a knife or a flashlight and I never have one when I need it. And they're there I own a bunch of them they're like scattered throughout my house but never at hand when I need it.

Unknown 45:27
And the thing was I mean I see I don't know anything about knives I'm not really a knife or gun person and this is like this is very much like everyday carry tactical stuff

Unknown 45:38
that's like saying I'm not really I'm not really an ibuprofen or heroin

Unknown 45:44
but it's hard it's hard to like it's hard to get very far into these worlds See also security cameras

Unknown 45:50
right all right before you start running into nuts

Unknown 45:53
yeah exactly like like when I like if you start looking into like security cameras flashlights and

Unknown 45:58
Marco Marco you lock picking lawyer lock picking lawyer is so great, but he's a fucking gun nut and it comes up after you watch like 40 videos

Unknown 46:07
Yeah, all of these like everyday carry people they're all gun nuts, right? They all want to show you their guns and they all fantasize about using their guns so like i don't i'm super not into that and so to me I only care about the flashlight side of this then even the knife side like you know you'll talk about this I guess later but like the knife side like I don't I respect the utility of knives but I just I don't care

Unknown 46:27
you don't have you don't have any guns yet. What if? What if someone tweets at your wife?

Unknown 46:32
What are you gonna do with that them

Unknown 46:36
would probably crash.

Unknown 46:37
Okay, so here here's one thing and this is a very, very, very high level pop in the stack as john Syracuse's says but here here's the theme between these two things that are useful is that like if you do get a little bit into the nerdy worry what I'll just generally call pocket knives and what I'll generally call you know, pocket flashlights. They are really it's really useful to find the right thing, the right combination of things you need to deploy in your life right so the one that I'm the Phoenix that you turned me on to Marco hangs on my backpack outside, it weighs nothing I don't notice it doesn't even doesn't even pull down on you know, the backpack pull down. kind of annoying thing. Yeah, so light, but it's like three, whatever, three and 20 lumens. Like it's right there. If I need to, like go take out the trash in an alley, it's always there. But if the right like the right knife for the job, and the right flashlight for the job can be deployed and and so why would you need to think as much about flashlights? Well, as we'll talk about, there's a weird matrix of combinations of things. Yeah, you'll get a lot of lumens out of this, but like how long will the battery last? And like how easy is it to use if you have to turn it on really quickly? And that's all sounds silly. But like, once you start having a flashlight, it's like carrying a pen. Really. It's like suddenly you will find a use for it all the time. It's so that's the theme.

Unknown 47:47
Well and there's other things there's like it isn't just about like you know, battery and weight but also like, how easily replaced like how easily Can you find these batteries? If the apocalypse comes and zombies are everywhere and you run a flashlight batteries? like can you just buy it at a store? Or do you have to like order it? Or

Unknown 48:02
can I need a USB charger for this one?

Unknown 48:04
So you have it you have a whole Can you have a whole contingency plan? Where if the zombies come you'll have you can get batteries for your flashlights, but you won't have any guns at all. No gun no guns at all.

Unknown 48:15
Yeah, well, because it turns out I hate to ruin this for everybody. But it turns out the zombies aren't real and power outages are

Unknown 48:24
apocalypse.

Unknown 48:26
apocalypse short.

Unknown 48:28
You'll be great if there's if you need to establish a things

Unknown 48:33
very quickly open a lot of breakdown a lot of Amazon boxes, sci fi

Unknown 48:39
scenarios like Alfred Hitchcock's the birds, but it's Amazon deliveries

Unknown 48:57
welcome we're here to talk about stuff carrion lighter stab with God where we begin with this.

Unknown 49:05
I don't know what the challenges anymore because I don't have any flashlights. But I got a lot of knives. And I mean, I will say I had been making fun of you all for quite a while. But then my power was out for I think 18 hours and couldn't get it. I thought I owned a crank flashlight. I don't. But those are terrible.

Unknown 49:27
But they're never a battery. You just go crank crank crank and then it lights up. Yeah, but you know, batteries are pretty easy to get.

Unknown 49:33
Yeah, just give your money to KCRW. Now you don't need you don't need the How do you come maybe one way to approach this might be useful is Marco, tell us about your background with this stuff. Or maybe even just focus on like, what kind of decision making goes into how you choose the right flashlight for the job.

Unknown 49:51
show it's all for number one is size and weight like that. They're all these different size classes of these things like and I don't like anything much bigger than the like biggest heaviest ones I have are these are the ones that use to double A batteries. This used to be the own Phoenix is my preferred brand. There's a bunch of there's a few other brands that all make similar things but but Phoenix seems to have a really really good value for the money and really good quality for that. So anyway, the two double A models that I've had for a while at the LD 22 and the old one is similar but at 12. And those are great if you're limited yourself to double A batteries, triple A flashlights I find not not like good enough for their size reduction. Like they are smaller and lighter. But like there's so much worse. IWH is my size class usually. But what I discovered which makes it Max was alluding to earlier is the world of lithium battery flashlights, which I think is a fairly recent and this because like double A batteries, you know regular batteries there 1.5 volts lithium are 3.6 3.7. So like you can get a lot more voltage out of it. And it also handles fastest charging better doesn't necessarily weigh as much as alkaline. So like lithium rechargeable batteries are the way are these

Unknown 51:07
fully interchangeable with with my battery setup.

Unknown 51:11
Well your battery setup is full of no loop double A's, right?

Unknown 51:14
Well, I don't even know anymore.

Unknown 51:16
Okay, I'm going to tell you what to get. So usually for most people's needs the the tube, the two double A flashlights are a little bit big and a little bit heavy. If you're going to get just one fancy flashlight, the one I would suggest is the Phoenix LD 12. This is and the newly I think it's like the 2017 version, and we'll put the link in the show notes. So this is one that uses a single as my that as my as

Unknown 51:39
they say every day.

Unknown 51:41
Yes, it uses a single double A battery normally, and it can get pretty bright with that. But here's the trick. If you have a special lithium version, it's it's shaped like a double A but you can't use it like one because higher voltage you can't you have to use different charger for it. But it's called a 14 500. So, and if you have a 14 500 which you usually read and they're amazingly fun to charge up because they're so cool. I'm really boring. No, no you're not you have one

Unknown 52:08
of those ones are almost like the new.

Unknown 52:10
So I can't I can't put that in my Gameboy

Unknown 52:13
No, it would mess it up and and the special chargers charge it, but it's shaped like a double A so it looks the same so be careful. But anyway, if you saw this this last week, you know it can take double A's but if you put in a 14 500 battery, it becomes way brighter. And last for longer time view they can use the higher voltage so it's kind of the best of both worlds like I have a smaller one which is also really fun really nice the PD 25 that's super fun, super nice also but and that uses the it uses a special kind of battery called this car 123 A which you can get like little boxes of 20 of them and they last forever they're lithium actually that one has another interesting fact some of these batteries the the battery itself, there's finished pieces little yellow batteries themselves that have USB input ports battery, so you can take the battery out of the flashlight. Yep, plug it into a micro USB and charge up the battery from a micro USB cable wherever you are. Oh my god so yep, that's the one I usually travel with is the the PD 25 for that reason, it's almost as bright as the ELD 12 but it's a little bit smaller, a little bit lighter and has that USB rechargeable car 123 a battery.

Unknown 53:21
How big are we talking about like a like a Burt's Bees bigger than that battery

Unknown 53:25
or the flashlight I would say the size of a full size chapstick full size full size a little bit smaller than a glue family size. A little bit smaller than glue stick like a typical like school glue stick a little bit smaller than that.

Unknown 53:39
Were you

Unknown 53:42
able to see the photos that are being

Unknown 53:44
chaps what big chaps oh I'm not I'm not paying attention

Unknown 53:48
if you look in the chat I have I showed you an iPhone SE for comparison the two and talking about it the two on the left.

Unknown 53:54
Oh look at this and there you can see mine that's the mines the brown table His is the pretty one

Unknown 54:01
on my left is my LD 12 yeah

Unknown 54:04
these look these look very tactical I really

Unknown 54:08
think you might be a tactical operator

Unknown 54:11
this is the problem so like so when I'm looking at these like so many of them are like you know made for armed forces and police tactical and many of us being massaged

Unknown 54:21
many of them even advertise a like tactical mode where it like strobes really brightly to try to like throw off attackers.

Unknown 54:30
Anybody with epilepsy is fucked

Unknown 54:32
yeah like it's they all have like special knows you're like if you hold on the button the right way it'll become a weapon

Unknown 54:38
back on this you don't want too many modes because now you're fucking around with your flashlight when all you want is something super bright for a second

Unknown 54:44
zombies don't have epilepsy that this the modes thing this is my number one opinion on flashlights that is that I think the mode and the on off should be two separate buttons Oh turn it on no matter how often or how quickly or how short you turn it on turns on to the whatever brightness you had it set to last time and you know all these flashlight brands they all mess that up except for this very small handful of them and this is why I buy a bunch of Phoenix is that all look pretty similar because they have like some of their flashlights and this is why I

Unknown 55:14
call it the digital watch the digital watch button problem. Yes, exactly. It's like you don't want one button that does fucking everything. It's crazy. So like the Phoenix like you say on the bottom of it, you've got the turning on part and then on near the top where the beam comes out you've got this other thing you can click the change modes but like the last thing you want to do if like like assume an emergency you know what I mean? Assuming emergency and the last thing you want is a Blinky light when you're like trying to get out of a car or something

Unknown 55:41
well I don't even assume an emergency I assume a dog walk at night but like annoying it's annoying to like turn on the flashlight and it's way brighter way damn we have to like click it on click it off click it on like hit some mode sequence thing that's annoying so these should be buttons and there are very very few flashlights that separate those into two different today buttons especially at the smaller end. So that's why I like the the PDF 25 I think is the smallest one I found that does that. So yeah, so PB 25 is my good small one ld 12 new version is my good medium sized one. And then I also have this big boy in the middle here that uses the same kind of battery that my car uses which is kind of satisfying. Well this is the Phoenix UC 35 oh man it's the only one of these that has a USB recharging port on the flashlight itself. So they'll use like flip back and slow cover and you can plug into micro USB and recharge the flashlight from the outside

Unknown 56:31
it's pretty big pretty heavy way too big for like a pants pocket but you know fine for a bag. And it is ridiculously bright. It is just so comically bright for its size. So just just just for our listeners who don't have a visual in front of them and this is this tripped me up as well because I don't know how to say words. Phoenix is spelled FENIX and you're the one you like here that's like your car is the FENIX Phoenix UC three five

Unknown 56:56
and is that all the way on the right

Unknown 56:57
middle it's the one in the middle big big family time

Unknown 57:00
oh it's the big kind of showed

Unknown 57:02
yeah like the battery inside of it is it is it is a lithium 18 650 which is a very common battery cell that like many of our lithium battery powered things from like battery packs all the way up to Tesla's are powered by large arrays of these things. So it looks like kind of like a fat double A

Unknown 57:20
I didn't know that that's that's fascinating. Okay,

Unknown 57:22
but yeah, like like like my car has 7000 of these Whoa, that must get heavy

Unknown 57:27
Yes. God wait Hang on. That's the one which was the

Unknown 57:35
Tesla you have any team 650 in there somewhere right

Unknown 57:40
areas

Unknown 57:41
yeah Big Blue but one looks like about the right size for it.

Unknown 57:44
Yeah, that's kind of big the eminent and this one is the is the 266500 that's

Unknown 57:51
that's not smaller I think or no that's bigger

Unknown 57:56
man I

Unknown 58:00
now these all seem these are all the same brand right? These are all Phoenix is there like a different kind of texture on each of these? Are they all the same like carbon fiber looking? Not quite mad but like extreme texture type thing? It looks very pleasant to hold

Unknown 58:20
Yeah, they all have the like like the painted black metal I think it's aluminum pan black metal bodies and then they have like the world sections in the middle. Yeah, so it's it's the same and you know, it looks different just just from lighting. It's the same like kind of neural texture and all them

Unknown 58:34
Oh, I want an iPhone made out of this. My god.

Unknown 58:37
Oh, yeah, that'd be great. You'd be able to hold on to it.

Unknown 58:40
I know it. You know one thing one thing just to mention if it seems like this is like really like ridiculous navel gazing it is but it's also fun. Um, like in the past if you wanted to get pretty decent trying to get some reasoning why you might want to care about this it's you don't have to care Don't worry. It used to be in the past that if you want to get even halfway decent you know a level of light out of a flashlight you had to have one of those big cop flashlights that holds like the batteries yeah D batteries or even think about the Energizer that you could buy at the drugstore as a kid the silver one with the red top that every boy scout Yeah, that was two D's and then a what is that an incandescent bulb woody call that Yep,

Unknown 59:21
yep and get a little incandescent bulb and it would last like an hour maybe

Unknown 59:24
right well so so what's so what's different about these well you get these are LED flashlights with so much more battery power pushing that out through the LED so you get you get a much more you get much more control of the beam you get a lot more power power in terms of milliamp hours that are there will hold plus lumens that it will output and that's all in a package that fits in your pocket. So why care about this outdoor you don't care about this but if you are wondering why would someone care about this well with us your glove box or the outside of your backpack or you know somewhere in the basement or like I have one by my kids bed because if the lights go off now she knows where there's a flashlight but it doesn't need to be like a cop beat me over the head size flashlight that that's why I'm fascinated by what you can accomplish with the right combinations of things.

Unknown 1:00:11
Oh yeah, cuz now like these little tiny like the smallest one I have here is probably significantly brighter and with longer lasting battery than the one of those giant D flashlights would have been like in 1995. Yeah,

Unknown 1:00:22
I keep thinking about the button situation and I want there to be like a consortium of I don't know if that's the word I said that word right. of different companies who make different products like keyboards vibrators fug phones like every type of thing that could have a button on the great buttons and like I feel like this is a problem that could be easily solved in like a light switch people there should be every kind of switch there should be like how there is that big USB like okay, what's the standard and just like it sharing of the like the I don't know I don't know like the patent should be what you want it to be consistent consistency

Unknown 1:01:07
no

Unknown 1:01:08
not consistency but just like the okay you have a great button on this flashlight. You have a great button on this keyboard and just have have them all talk and be friends together. Everybody wins. Huh? I want like a flashlight. flashlight talking to what was the flashlight? flashlight. The flashlight should talk the flashlight people should talk to like the vibrator people and the keyboard people and the what else has buttons? Oh, like the switchboard people to all create great buttons is this. Is this a place? This is the place you go in your mind palace where they all talk to you. Yeah, they all talk. They all talk about the other buzzy.

Unknown 1:01:51
Everything's good.

Unknown 1:01:54
Hold on. Let's see with these. The same with the clips. Oh god. I didn't want it to be a vibrator to
