dodgy dossier as Carter page likes to say, there's two major things in there that have not had evidence behind them. There's the one thing that we all know. Then the other thing is, you remember after came out

Max 0:22
That tommy gun of hydration, if you will.

Merlin 0:25
Yes. Michael Cohen, in a brilliant lawyerly move, posted a photo of the front of his passport and said, I've never been to Prague. So, leaving aside the tommy gun for just a minute, do we think it will eventually come out that he has multiple passports and has been to Prague

Max 0:44
but but I have been to tons of countries where for whatever reason that transpired I didn't get a passport stamp.

Alex 0:51
Doesn't that suck?

Max 0:52
And It bothers me

Merlin 0:53
that's totally random. They're in like totally ran. It's not like there's you like she started like showing it. It's like a little lady

Max 0:58
getting a stamp on your passport is an old fashioned thing I think, I think it used to be in, in an analog world. They were very rigorous about every time you cross the border, you got the stamp, because that was how you tracked it. But now I think they basically barcode the passport and it goes into computer system. And that's how you know when someone's order for you. Right? But but I've been to many countries, including, like, I believe, I think when I went to China, I saw I landed in China and I transferred airplanes, but I did well for whatever reason we went through customs in China. And then I had to go through customs again to fly out to go to Vietnam. And I didn't get a passport stamp and I was really upset because I was like, cool to get a passport, Sam and China. And like, I'm telling you like, the quick everyone should have an interest like if they were doing passports to some kind of security or verification, then everyone would care that I have a stamp from China. Right? Right. Right, right. So I mean, we've talked about Michael Cohen like DF give a quick thought on Michael Cohen. Oh, he's completely he's totally he's dirt. All does it seem like it might be going down. All the Trump people are...

Merlin 2:02
He seems pretty fucked. And I got a thought about the taxi medallions too, for what it's worth.

Max 2:05
All the...I don't know anything about that. You have to explain that to me all

Merlin 2:07
He owns dozens of taxi medallions. And I got a feeling it's going to come down to...he...My guess is so he worked for the shady guy involving taxis. He's a mini medallions back when they were worth a million dollars. I think it's going to emerge that he has been borrowing against the taxi medallions. And now the value of the taxi medallions has gone down like all these other guys. Now he's scrambling.

Alex 2:28
Am I being a dingus? What's the taxi medallion? Is this old school Bitcoin? I actually don't know what this is.

Merlin 2:33
Usually, Um, like in New York City, you can be awarded a taxi like a liquor license. It's a thing. And so it used to be like in San Francisco, a taxi medallion was like, I mean, it's a huge deal. It's a license to make money, like a liquor license. They only give so many of them and he owns something like 20 of them, you guys don’t follow this stuff like I do...

Alex 2:51
It is, it’s old school Bitcoin!

Max 2:52
You know what? Yeah, no, I think, Merlin. I think you might be right. I mean, let me like

Merlin 2:58
They drop precipitously, precipitously and value after Uber got big right and it became a huge fucking deal because all these people I heard about this on various NPR shows about that these guys who were like, on paper were worth millions and they now...

Max 3:11
I think they were all mobbed. I think there was all mobbed up back in the day too

Merlin 3:14
Right...but the thing was, you could that was an asset that you could borrow against your taxi medallions.

Max 3:20
When we know that Trump did was was in bed with the mob. Oh, and various. We know that in fact, there's like lawsuits and and evidence in court presented to show..

Merlin 3:29
There’s too many people that he's one person away from. So he's Yeah, he did during the meetup be like a Frank Sinatra thing. But there's a lot of people. (Unintelligible)

Max 3:36
I mean, apparently you didn't you just nobody did construction and the time that Trump was doing construction in Manhattan without interfacing with the mafia, but he also specifically there were lawsuits and stuff involving that. But anyway, just to take a step back, like Michael Cohn is definitely fucked. I mean, if you think of all the different people who conservative Republican judges who approved this warrant, and the fact that the FBI did a...The bar is so high. And the fact that the FBI did a no knock raid simultaneously in three locations, it indicates that maybe they haven't won like a conspiracy charge, and they thought...

Merlin 4:10
and it's something you know, it's something we don't know. Is it election stuff? I don't think it is. Is it still no real stuff? No, that's part of it. I think there's something fucking huge that maybe and I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be like that guy here or not. I agree with Normandy, the enormity of going to the President's lawyer with a no knock search in three places, is a very fucking big deal. I'm gonna say I think it's something we don't even know about. Yeah, I agree. I gotta be something. I'm not even talking about the hundreds. Bannon says there's dozens or hundreds of deals with women out there. I think it's gonna be something we can't even fucking imagine at this point.

Max 4:40
I actually, I'm inclined to agree with you, I would guess based on so the fact that they got the no knock warrant on three locations at once, to me indicates

Merlin 4:47
a ticking bomb scenario

Max 4:48
it to me, it's like some sort of conspiracy charge, because what you're worried about is that there's other associates and Confederates who would would would coordinate to destroy evidence. So that's, that's what makes me think that maybe sure of it is organized crime or something along those lines, or we don't know. Yes,

Merlin 5:04
I'm thinking it's something, you know, terrorism, but it's it's something of grave import to something structural. I mean, beyond the election. So the whole like, Oh, this is about, you know,

Max 5:16
I don't know about...I don't know about that. You have to remember how I stu...

Merlin 5:19
have to remember how you think it's election. Do you think it's election violation?

Max 5:22
Merlin, you just have to remember how stupid and petty these people are and what they want out of life. They're not bond villains. They're not big thinkers. They're small thinkers. So it's probably it's probably like, I just probably like he had him. He was probably laundering mob of money in a golf course. That it's like you see what I’m saying? I'm saying it's small. its smallest. Small and stupid. You have to you have to think small and stupid. Not big and stupid with the Trump people. Does that make you see what I'm saying?

Merlin 5:52
No, no, I do. And I do. And I sure wish I hadn't used the word terrorism because you're going to think I'm an idiot. No, I mean, more like every single one of these guys what it comes down to is they need money. Almost all of these guys

Max 6:01
Oh, sure. But Paul Manafort...

Merlin 6:01
If you can afford Manafort through Kushner through Trump, Manafort was a huge money from somebody.

Max 6:09
Manafort was a huge financial crime. me

Merlin 6:11
Oh, he owed money to like the Russian mob?

Max 6:13
Yes, it was a huge financial crime. But when I say small and stupid, what I mean is that he got busted because he was laundering money through an expensive rug shop. Right?

Merlin 6:23
And his suits

Max 6:23
Right. And he was buying, he was buying $10,000 suits, and rugs. That's what I mean by small and stupid. So it's not going to be that he was a Bond villain and had an underground submarine. And then he was buying all the world's newspapers, and it's no Q Anon thing. It's like, it's probably that that he was using his money from his own charity by oil paintings of himself. If you can imagine...if you can imagine something that crazy.

Merlin 6:46
The thing everybody knows about. Everybody who's a idiot and follows his nose is the Cohen is not a lawyer in the conventional sense. He has one employee, pretty much he did not get called up to the bigs because A. who knows where his bodies are buried and B. he needed to preserve the Lawyer/Client privileged, privileged by not being in the White House where he would have lost the privilege he needed to stay in Manhattan. But what has he mostly done? Yes, B. he's fixed things, and intimidated people and bullied, but A. he's a deal guy. That's the thing is Cohen's huge value to Trump, apart from making women go away is the deals. But here's the thing. If it was deals, wouldn't that most likely have been under Mueller’s purview? I don't know. Like, what is it? The interesting part if he threw this, to the southern district...

Max 7:34
right... I think the women maybe it could be the women, the women or the women a mob thing or a women thing would be would be better resource to handle in the New York judge. But But anyhow, let me just I just want to take a step back for a second because I know I got excited about the raids and all that and like the President's Personal lawyer getting rated like God, Jesus Christ, like not even Nixon, did we see that level of crony of insane cronyism, and then the bald faced like denials and “Oh, Michael Cohen, we never heard of the guy like that, you know, all that. That whole act

Merlin 8:09
as an opportunity to use one of my all time favorite names Bebe Rebozo. I love the name Bebe Rebozo.

Max 8:15
but anyhow, I'm taking that I just yeah, you know, yeah, Cohen’s dirty. Trump's whole inner circle is dirty is shitty kids are dirty. Jared Kushner certainly...

Merlin 8:28
That guy’s fucked

Alex 8:29
He seems like the most Bond villain of

Max 8:31
Kushner is certainly going to jail and and

Merlin 8:34
we're hearing so little about him which is very odd.

Max 8:37
Well, right. Remember, he was the superstar now where he we don't hear about him at all, because they probably know how fucked he is. He may become the fall guy and he just seems like the kind of fucking witless sap that they would all throw under the bus to as soon as things get tough, but

Alex 8:50
Ivanka is going to fuck him over.

Max 8:52
lot of these a lot of these guys are are are really fucked. And I...So what like what is that? What do people think that means like I heard on Twitter the whole take I've been hearing this week is is like “oh my god, Trump's gonna start hit this whole war” don't people are saying like, “Don't pay any attention is war in Syria Don't get distracted because Trump is going to use that to fire Mueller“ And it's like “you fucking idiots like Don't you understand that the war in Syria is the thing, that's the bad thing. That's why it matters. Who gives a fuck about Mueller or Kushner or the mob or Michael Cohn or any of this shit? It doesn't matter it's completely immaterial to your lives it's just the...”

Merlin 9:35
I disagree a little bit. I disagree a little bit because I think we are all

Max 9:38
I'm I'm completely Dr. Manhattan on this. I'm sitting on the moon going “I’m tired of the Earthlings nd their petty affairs. I'm completely Dr. Manhattan’d out. I don't care. I don't care. It doesn't affect me. What I care about is

Merlin 9:51
but what if he wipes out? Everybody? Like maybe he can't technically fire Mueller. But what if what if he has a really bad day this afternoon? And He gets he gets rid of Sessions. He gets rid of Rosenstein and he gets rid of Wray.

Max 10:04
Well, what what Maggie Haberman said is that he has given that order and he has said to his staff...this was interesting.

Merlin 10:11
Haberman back in December when they thought the Deutsche Bank stuff was going to come out. That was the last big time the McGann had to talk him off the ledge.

Max 10:18
Right, but but what meant what Hey, Maggie Haberman said on Twitter over the weekend was Trump said “Get rid of Mueller” many times to his staff, and they don't feel that they have the authority to do that or that it's actionable, what the President is saying, meaning Yeah, he could have a bad day and get drunk and yell at the White House paintings and they won't listen to what he's saying.

Alex 10:36
The most. I mean...

Max 10:37
now now I all I want to say is it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. We have to have a political victory because if Trump is, let's say that the entire administration is sent to jail and all you want to say Mike Pence is sent to jail Fine, then then Steve...Paul Ryan's retiring and, fine, Steve Scalise becomes president. What do you want? It's like, Tom... Tom Pruitt becomes president.

Alex 11:00
I am terrified of Trump being impeached because then it's then then it's the...

Max 11:05
It doesn't matter what...

Alex 11:07
It does matter though because if Trump is impeached then it's then it's the old right was was right then we then it's us we we did all this these conspiracies to get them out of office and that is...it scares me.

Max 11:19
What do you mean?

Alex 11:22
Think of all like his base? Is... his base goes fucking insane if he's impeached,

Max 11:31
and you think there's going to be like rioting actual Yeah, but they're all taking like Kratom, they're they're all they're all infirm.

Merlin 11:39
Did you see the latest?

Max 11:40
No.

Merlin 11:41
Um, this is weird. The FBI agents who raided the office and hotel This is her Anna Puzo and Mike Schmidt. FBI agents who raided the office and hotel of President Trump's lawyer on Monday we're seeking all records related to the Access Hollywood tape? This is according to three sources. What What the fuck? According to three people who have been briefed on the content of a federal search for...why?

Max 12:08
FBI agents sought all records related to Access Hollywood tape when they raided the office and Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. They wanted evidence of whether Cohen suppressed damaging info on the on Trump during the campaign...

Merlin 12:19
So, it might be the election angle.

Max 12:21
Well, well, probably...

Merlin 12:23
Feels like small potatoes.

Max 12:24
Well, that's what I'm saying. Small and stupid Merlin. He probably...

Merlin 12:28
Peewee potatoes

Max 12:29
They're small (Alex laughter) it's it's it's small and stupid.

Merlin 12:32
Barely visible.

Max 12:33
But I wonder I wonder if he stole I wonder if he Watergate in some of those tapes or something.

Merlin 12:41
God...Errrrrr...And I just my wife and I just like, you know you hear me at the end of this episode The 10 people will listen to and you realize how much attention I paid to a lot of this stuff. I don't like that about myself. But I just NO ERG my wife and I would just be like, you know, he you hear him speak publicly now and you realize how dumb the president is. He's really not smart. And honestly I'm sorry to say this. He's obviously he's losing his mental agility a little bit.

Alex 13:07
You can say he's crazy. It’s not ableist!

Max 13:11
He’s not crazy. No, no, no, no, no, he's not crazy,

Alex 13:13
This man has dementia.

Max 13:14
crazy. I'm not crazy. He's demented.

Alex 13:17
Yeah, well, yeah.

Merlin 13:19
that's what I'm saying but like, you know the way that he talks and he wants to impress everybody in the room for no particular reason where's all the fucking audio of this guy? It's got to be out there somewhere. *sigh* I just worried because I don't The reason I think this stuff is important is not just for the salacious value and because it gives me a thrill to see him be unhappy. It's because I'm keeps coming back to the same thing for me which is not fun and sexy, which is I think it's really a bummer that their reps representatives in particular house representatives has been so weak spined about this and I have a...what

Max 13:52
The new, the new, the new details from the warrent reveal the prosecutors are keenly interested in Mr. Cohen’s unofficial role in the Trump campaign and they help explain why Mr. Trump is furious about the raid. people close to Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen regard the warrant is an attempt by the special counsel, Robert Mueller to pry into Trump's personal life using other prosecutors as his proxy. So it's a combination of leverage. It's a combination of like leverage and they're finding little crimes like I bet

Merlin 14:17
Oh so you think this is in part of move to flip Cohen?

Max 14:20
Or put like pressure as the prosecutors friend, maybe it's not flip them but maybe it's neutralize or maybe it's get other people maybe it's to get the other people that he's talking to like, the more that if like, Listen, if Cohen is the rock right if Trump these people are called Trump and panic and he says “Cohen’s gonna get us out of it like I have a team” and then Mueller goes and does this big show of raiding Cohen’s house maybe it makes the other people flip because they fucking lose their mind the same way that we are. But regardless, that is the thing about when I say small and stupid if these guys do a million little shitty crimes, right? Who knows how they got those those Access Hollywood tapes and they stole them or they threaten them. Or maybe they do you know how they go after people for the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act for like using the wrong password or you know, they get someone gets does an unauthorized login and they go to jail as a hacker like Matthew Keys, maybe they can maybe they did a Computer Fraud and Abuse Act?

Merlin 15:13
In this case of an unlucky springing up. I think very interestingly, the the fact that there's just there's so many parts of this that don't line up from a logical standpoint. So he's a guy who under his bar rules, his client is supposed to know what he's doing in any kind of arrangement that involves deals or trials. So okay, so he struck a deal without telling his client, okay, that's a bar problem. He somehow found this money and paid for it. Okay, well, it's definitely at least an election violation. See, now I have an audience saying very interestingly, when you and you can tell me this is true. When you go to borrow money of any kind against your house, your homeland, whatever you're supposed to say on the line, what you're going to do with the money, and as everybody keeps saying, is very unlikely that he said, it's to pay off a porn star. Ditto the setting up an LLC. I know this is all as you say, small potatoes. When you set up an LLC, you're supposed to say what it's for. Does that LLC say “to pay off a porn star”? Like that's the kind of thing they might get him on as well. It's like super small potatoes stuff. Maybe it’s just Hollywood.

Alex 16:15
I'm still mad that she only got like $100,000. That’s not enough

Merlin 16:17
you know, that's because that's because she was forced to do this. And they had to

Max 16:23
They threatened her as well. It was a carrot and the stick.

Alex 16:27
know, I know. That's the thing, though, is so maybe maybe that's why he's a good this is I you guys know this it's very hard for me to follow this because I feel helpless. And I feel like there's nothing I can do. There's no connections I have, like I do.

Max 16:44
Just Okay, go Go on. And I want to respond to that

Alex 16:47
focus to like, like,

Max 16:49
I want to respond to that

Alex 16:50
I there I feel like there's nothing I can do. So I focus on like local Chicago stuff or EFF stuff or I feel like I have some knowledge I have some not expertise, but I am no not It's not that I have the knowledge but I know how to get the correct answers and know the folks who are smart and can help Does that make sense?

Max 17:09
Yes

Merlin 17:10
something is something that you can say so it's something that you care about in a primary way it's something that you can understand and something with a path to where it's almost like you're going through some kind of rehabilitation like you're able to say like “when I do these kinds of things the world improves in these ways.” Huge way

Alex 17:26
It might be an ego trip for me

Merlin 17:28
paying attention to this and putting my time and resources and attention here I can see the following improvement in actual real ways.

Alex 17:35
And I feel like max disagrees but in an interesting way

Max 17:39
no I...so I just wasn't

Alex 17:41
That wasn't a blow I'm here I'm here

Max 17:42
Yeah, I don't know I think there's two things if your field if I'm listening I'm feel it drives this stuff drives me insane that's why I have to have my Dr. Manhattan attitude because otherwise I go otherwise I go insane. And I and I do my red string board you know with like, I can't have a fucking string board in my house connecting all the... Yeah, I can't have a crazy wall in my basement. So you know so to me like there's two and I would give this as advice to anyone who feels anxiety or is stressed out about Trump or any of this stuff which is number one just think about you have to think about power and and what you can do with your time and your life and the same way that Republicans do. Republicans don't get mad online and spend all their time like tone policing other republicans and doing these like insular arguments about about whether comedians wherever funny or not, they take their anger about the world and they channel it into their local school board race and then they take over the school board and make it so you can't teach evolution. If you live Why don't our audience is a million times smarter and they have better taste on how to spend their money than any of any republican out there. Why don't you channel your energy if you don't want to run I mean A. run for office, run for dog catcher, run for school board, run for seriously, run for county board run for run for fine run for the fucking library board, progressive hills, I have progressive friends who ran for the library board and and all their job is is just making sure that there's like, like abolishing library fines and giving free information to people in their community. That's amazing. That is so much more productive than all of these fucking prognosticators and whiners and and and, and paladins on Twitter who go charging into battle every day like like, you know, like, like a medieval like, yeah, like like medieval times jousting, right? Where you knock each other's helmets off and then reset for tomorrow's show.

Alex 19:30
You know, my fireball is very fun.

Max 19:33
So So anyway, that's number one is is run for office or get involved in a local race. For me I want to jumping into I mean, I worked on a number of primaries here but then I really threw myself into this water reclamation district race that's a race like like I don't want to say that that race is behind me is beneath me normally but I will like like but definitely like I had I had the extra I had the extra energy in this cycle to do it because it was like a little material thing that I was like you know what, here's somewhere where I can do something like I can't fix everything but I can just keep this guy on the board to to cap clean drinking water that that's what I can do today. So just it's like what Merlin talked about the Martian thinking just think in terms of capabilities. What can you do today? Is that can you volunteer on a campaign Can you raise some money can use something that's something that's Trunk A. Trunk B like if you want to think of a different bucket that is more like culture war-ee kind of stuff like more Twitter based stuff or whatever, which is not as good as Bucket A which is actually materially doing something. But But Bucket B is pick an issue that you think is motivational to people, right? So I just mentioned a great one, just abolition of library finds library fines are bullshit, they don't work. They're regressive. They're terrible. And I know some people who that's their thing in life is they want to do away with library fines. Just pay it

Merlin 20:44
I like that.

Max 20:44
Just pick an issue like

Merlin 20:45
And john oliver that shit. That's a good one.

Max 20:47
It's a great one. It's I mean, you'll I think you'll be hearing more about this movement in the future but just pick something right maybe it's you think that pre pretrial a detention of people in jail of people of color in jails is of creating like, like a debtors prison and a permanent underclass of people who never get a trial or maybe you think that space

Merlin 21:06
just creates creates and props up the bail bond industry.

Max 21:09
Yeah, I mean, I don't whatever I mean, I don't know maybe you're mad about, about clean air, clean water, whatever it is. Just pick something and start small. Just pick a small local issue of something that really bugs you that no one else really cares about. Maybe you care about net neutrality, or campaign finance or education or whatever it is. But don't pick like a huge broad topic. Like focusing on one one little thing, right? Like Like, like, we want modern modern textbooks for our schools classrooms, and just fix it. Raise awareness of it make people think you do it the Parkland kids are doing right like you pick like one specific thing. One little you get your little wedge right one little doorstop and you just drive it in and every day you're just trying to you're just trying to pound that thing in one millimeter more until you get people talking about it and

Merlin 21:52
much much harder to get distracted when you are one issue person.

Max 21:55
Yeah, so find your find your issue and hammer around it and and you know, I would I mean, whatever, don't pick something else that everyone else is mad about to right? So don't pick a representation of different races and genders and superhero movies because that's, we already have. We've got we've got our best guys on the case. You know. (Alex laughter) We've already assigned a detail to that. We've already we've we already have a we already have. We already have the fifth, third and fourth armies marching on that on that theater. You know what I'm saying...

Jazz Break 22:28
Jazz Break for the ending

Merlin 22:30
all right, that's good. 37 minutes, that aughta give them something.
