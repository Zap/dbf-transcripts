Let's see.

Unknown 4:51
First of all, we got him. First of all, I have posted I don't know if you guys want to talk about it or not. But the Washington Post had a really good tip top of the whole sort of Ukraine story going all the way back to the Manafort days. I thought I actually thought this was very informative. And for me, it really like filled in the gaps of all the little weird, weird things I didn't know. For example, did you know that the current president of Ukraine it was before he was president was famous for being a comedian who played the president of Ukraine on TV?

Unknown 5:19
Yes, yes. And he was he was so good in the part that everyone knew. They love to see it. They knew he had to be the real the real thing. Yeah, it would be like if Martin Sheen got elected.

Unknown 5:30
I think we should everyone should read this. Yeah, I read it. And it was very helpful. It was tons of stuff. I didn't know that was in here. And I think maybe we'll put that in the show notes.

Unknown 5:38
Well, that's and that's the thing with what's coming down with the last two days my free throws.

Unknown 5:43
last two days have been just brutal. And like super interesting. Like it's been wild to be sitting here and watch all yesterday. Everything that happened before noon, my time after months and months ago. Excuse me, after years and years of Holy fucking shit people. I feel like I'm losing my goddamn mind. Are you not seeing this? And then by noon yesterday was like What is? What is happening? And then and then and then you got the Rudy stuff. You got to talk about the Rudy stuff. And the bar stuff. What is happening, Merlin you seem you seem really online, on prem online than I'd like. I'm not not thrilled about it.

Unknown 6:20
I've reinstalled the Twitter app as of yesterday.

Unknown 6:24
I am back Yeah, I have this new feature where you can swipe into your lists,

Unknown 6:29
which is actually lyst swipes. I love it. I

Unknown 6:31
hate to combo I hate to give anything to Twitter, but it is a good feature. It's a great feature.

Unknown 6:36
It makes you want to use tons more lists. Yeah.

Unknown 6:39
Oh god, I'm in the matrix. Wow. All right. Uh, where is I cannot find this Washington Post thing. It's

Unknown 6:48
the first link

Unknown 6:53
you click on that it'll take you to write our article is a post on the website. Got

Unknown 6:57
it. But how does it work? What does it What does it do?

Unknown 7:00
No. Okay, I know we just manner but

Unknown 7:02
there's so much to cover max. We don't have time for a lot of digressions.

Unknown 7:05
So last night, there was a big story where and local Chicago news or whatever was on that call the police scanner, Twitter's. And basically police were responding to a pressure cooker found Oh, yeah, it was even the garbage can outside of the stands doughnuts.

Unknown 7:21
That was funny. Max, you were funny about

Unknown 7:23
Veronica and I were looking at it. And I said Veronica was really worried. She goes, Oh my god, are they gonna get bombed? And I was like, we've been to that standard. And I go, and I go, you know, I don't know how a pressure cooker works. And I'm really scared to Google it. I don't want to go on Google and be like, how does a pressure cooker Whoa, but I'm thinking like, so I fundamentally get the idea that you somehow you put nails in it and then you

Unknown 7:46
load works in it and then it makes a bomb

Unknown 7:49
and but you overload it with pressure somehow and then it pressure is next

Unknown 7:53
but but pressure is overloading that's what it

Unknown 7:56
how it but the thing is like this was pressure cooker was just left out by garbage can. And and it didn't. How are you going to like keep loading it. And so the rock was like, well, maybe they filled it with pressure at home. And then they brought it over there.

Unknown 8:09
This is a famous kind of improvised device. This is the Atlanta bubble.

Unknown 8:13
And I know I know, but but so the moronic was maybe they they're just going to fill it with pressure at home and then bring it outside the donut shop and leave it. So it's

Unknown 8:21
like an explosive potluck.

Unknown 8:22
And I'm like, but but I'm like, but we use a pressure cooker all the time to make gains, and we filled with pressure and it doesn't explode. So why would you left it on a sidewalk? Why would it explode? Like that doesn't make any sense to me. I think

Unknown 8:31
they might be I think they might be voiding the warranty by not following the directions in the manual.

Unknown 8:36
But But do you understand what I'm saying here is like how what specifically how does it explode? It's

Unknown 8:41
not do not cook. You can't tell if you're picking the PIs? No, it's an improvised device where you could use a cell phone to to cause cause it to explode. I think

Unknown 8:49
it has its own Wikipedia articles. And

Unknown 8:54
so the part that I understand is that I'm not clicking that. No,

Unknown 8:57
no, it's Wikipedia. It's mine

Unknown 8:59
heard looked up stigmata and Richard specs.

Unknown 9:04
Richard speck and pressure cooker bomb let's

Unknown 9:06
get that did you get the photo of him in the bikini?

Unknown 9:08
Alex I wish you wouldn't Texas to me. Can I let me just please?

Unknown 9:11
It's pretty bad. Oh, no, no, no. Stop Alex stop. No, that's good. scrub your recommendations on YouTube. What are you enjoying encryption? And

Unknown 9:20
I'm seriously very confused with this. So I understand the point where you were like nails in the pressure cooker and it explodes but I use a pressure cooker all the time and it doesn't explode how RN it's not even plugged in. How are these people making it explode? Oh,

Unknown 9:34
well if I said how, then it's like admitting I know how to make a bomb on a podcast. So

Unknown 9:43
know someone on Twitter last night I posted Twitter and someone on Twitter goes they're putting explosives in the pressure cooker?

Unknown 9:49
I mean there are ways to get power to a pressure cooker that doesn't involve an

Unknown 9:54
outlet you don't have you guys you don't have to power the pressure cooker by so I don't fucking oh well they say yeah, I don't actually acting like I know No, you know the plug it in, you're not going to see Vito roast. It's just the pressure is what is needed to create the bomb effect.

Unknown 10:08
But But let me ask you this. What So what you're saying is you're saying the same thing that someone do you say

Unknown 10:13
how even did they get the pressure if they did it at home?

Unknown 10:15
Okay, so someone on Twitter yesterday said they're putting explosives in the pressure cooker and then detonating it. And somehow it being in the pressure cooker like supercharged is it turbo charges the explosives? Is that is that the deal? Merlin. What I was what I was thinking is like you know the great commando non Johnny bit about the cheese. The kids are doing cheese. No, fucking Give me the cord kicked off the podcast.

Unknown 10:40
I'm trying to I'm trying to find the really good GIF of the exploding pressure cooker. We're putting a hole in the ceiling. I can't find it.

Unknown 10:47
I know it's bad. I know. It's powerful and bad. I just do. So listen. So here's my whole sort of premise with this. Because I know some people are saying Okay, so what the the way the pressure cooker thing works is that the way the pressure cooker thing works is you have an existing explosive and you put it in there, and it's somehow supercharged is it but then it made me you already have an explosive you don't need a pressure cooker do That's what I'm saying. And that reminded me of this wonderful classic stand up bit from friend of the show coming on on Johnny, big fan

Unknown 11:15
is filling in for a second new drug cocktail called cheese. And I'd read all four or five news reports on this new drug called cheese and sweeping the nation. Kids in the Midwest, they're doing it it's an epidemic. It's a new drug. It's an epidemic. But I looked up a cheese is cheese is Tylenol PM, and heroin.

Unknown 11:37
So really, it's

Unknown 11:44
doing the heavy lifting.

Unknown 11:47
cocktail. It's not a new drug. It's mostly heroin.

Unknown 11:54
Heroin on pancakes and go.

Unknown 11:58
Shake cakes. Don't forget

Unknown 12:05
this special shape size, maple syrup and heroin.

Unknown 12:13
It's not a new drug is my point. It's mostly heroin. I think the last new drug was crystal meth, which you had to make in your bathtub. And if you fucked up while you were making it, everything would explode and you would die. That's a dangerous drug and just try to make it can kill you. And you make it just from shaky get at the store to make cheese. You still need heroin.

Unknown 12:51
Heroin was at least in cheese, but it's

Unknown 12:57
Yeah, let's just uh, yeah, I you know what heartache. I agree.

Unknown 13:02
But do you see what i'm saying though is like if you already have a bunch of explosive is a bootstrap paradox. Yeah.

Unknown 13:10
What do you have to put them in a pressure? What is the pressure?

Unknown 13:13
Like a turbocharger?

Unknown 13:18
I don't know. Max, your point is very good. will definitely follow up. Dr. Dr. Dawn, maybe Dr. Don does have them. Oh,

Unknown 13:24
yeah. What does it do though? The pressure cooker.

Unknown 13:28
All right.

Unknown 13:41
So do I Friday? Do I Friday was in the New York Times?

Unknown 13:44
Oh, you know, I don't get to do my one paragraph reading series. Yeah. We'd love for you to do that. Everybody, of course, is we're reading over this. It's not a transcript. Twitter. The but but there. Boy, if they thought this was going to look good, it really doesn't look good. And this is this is the forgot I woke up. I picked up the phone. First thing I read this morning. I would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot. And Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine. They say CrowdStrike I guess you have one of your wealthy people. The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on the whole situation. I think I think you're surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people. And I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday. That whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Miller and incompetent performance. But they say a lot of it started with you.

Unknown 14:49
Whatever you do, it's very important that you do it if that's possible. I think Gandhi said that.

Unknown 14:54
I understood about 15

Unknown 14:57
Oh my God, he's melting down. He's come on. In

Unknown 15:01
what what am I looking at here? Is this is something Trump said today.

Unknown 15:03
Yeah, this is the from the whatever we're calling it that the White House released today of him talking to the president to the actor, man of Ukraine. And no so so just here's a quick translation. So basically, he's congratulations on your terrific win. Everyone. Many people are saying that it was a huge win. And then he can he cuts right into I'm pretty sure Hillary Clinton's email server is in Ukraine. Can you find that for us? And that's that's from July of the year of our fucking Lord. 2019.

Unknown 15:37
But we know it wasn't in Ukraine. It was in her basement. Yeah.

Unknown 15:40
And also will

Unknown 15:44
server they say Ukraine has it?

Unknown 15:47
Okay. All right.

Unknown 15:48
So So apparently this is a thing he's had going for a while where he's I don't know how this got in his head. He has this it No, it's not a no as 10 it's not like a Mac Pro. And Hillary Clinton's basement. Now apparently it is the server in Ukraine. Anyways, that's just part of what we learned today. Not even getting into the Rudy shit. And the fucking bar shit. Oh, my fucking God, please contact my attorney general. So we can do some of these things I want to do. Oh, okay. I don't know if we got him. I don't know if we got him. But

Unknown 16:19
the I don't even barely understand this whole scandal. Do you think the American people are going to stay the scandal is

Unknown 16:24
the scandal. So I my understanding of this in a night. What led to this last verse super interesting week or last few weeks is that somebody in the so when when the President has contact, you know, with people heads of state, there's usually somebody there they rotate in and out. It's not very much definitely not probably a White House employee. But there's somebody from the intelligence community who's sort of listening in on what's happening. And the story is that whoever that person is, heard something in this call. And it's not just the call this is very important. But in the call alone, there was something that led to this them starting to blow the whistle, as they say, and the whistle blowing and this is this is you can't just call your boss and say, Hey, I think some bad shots going down. You have to contact the Inspector General, for I think the NI and and you say, you know, basically, I know the rules here. I'm pulling, I'm pulling the switch because there is a credible, an urgent matter involving national security that has to be dealt with. So you're hitting the big red button to go this needs to be escalated. That inspector general then passes that along to I think it's it needs to go to Congress, it needs to go to Adam shifts committee, the White House somehow sat on it or wouldn't allow it to go to Congress, Adam Schiff had a had a conniption fit with his tiny little head on msnbc. And anyway, long story short, that's where where this started, the most recent stuff is what you need to know today axioms Be smart, which you need to know today is that there was an attempt to conceal the fact that there was a whistleblower report about this. And further to that, that, apparently, the reason that was one imagines the reason that whistleblower stuff didn't go through, is because it contains some pretty ill shit about Trump basically the equivalent of soliciting a bribe, saying, and I'll give you $400 million in aid, which Congress has already approved a hold that I'm holding that for a week, I might give it to you later, but I need you to find out what the deal was with hunter Biden, because he is cricket father are corrupt. And I'm very concerned about corruption. And then now that's that's all unraveling very quickly. The whistleblower the whistleblower wants to basically appear before his committee, I think tomorrow as we record this

Unknown 18:44
is do you think this is more? Is it somehow worse than the others to all the other stuff Trump?

Unknown 18:51
I'll give you one note on this from a man has been to online for the last 36 hours. And that is this I think, an important bellwether here is our as our friend Nancy Pelosi, who does not like to proceed, she is stonewalled on anything approaching impeachment because she didn't have the votes, right. Like she didn't she it was worth it. She loves her. She loves being in power. She got a lot of pressure from people in purple districts and new Congress persons got a lot of pressure to do this. And I think here's here's my takeaway from this. She said as much at the Atlantic her interview at the Atlantic arts thing yesterday. This is this just happened. And it's very plain to understand why what happened and why it's wrong. We do not need a 400 page report to understand what happened here is clear on the face of it that this is something that the public can understand. So consequently, this is something that Congress can get behind. Now my last thing on this and I'll shut up you hope is that my tickle tickle on these things always is there's stuff we don't know that they do know there's whispers like think about the stuff with the the steel dossier where that had gone around in circles for a while. There was a sort of Whisper campaign about that. I think there must be something to this. I don't know that I think she would so quickly push for impeachment. based on what we know. Exactly right. This moment publicly right now. Do you follow? Like I got a feeling. There's some fucking grenades rolling around. I don't know if they got him. But it's going to be a real shit show for the next few months. And I'm online for it. Your thoughts? Your thought?

Unknown 20:30
All right. Hold on. Hold on, Max. Before he before people get mad at you let people get mad at me first. I don't. I

Unknown 20:42
jumped in front of me and taking this boy,

Unknown 20:44
no, no, no, I am I'm dead serious about this. who care when you say like the public can understand this? Sure. It's like, okay, Ukraine, Donald Trump was trying to don't

Unknown 20:57
have a dog in this fight. But I will try to defend that position. Even though I don't have it's not strongly held. But please continue. That's I don't want to come off. I'm not want to come off as the guy and comments talking about we got Cheeto this time. I'm not

Unknown 21:08
saying you know, that's, that's why.

Unknown 21:14
What is happening? Wait, is this a bit? Okay. I'm just gonna. I don't know. All right. I don't

Unknown 21:22
see jazz.

Unknown 21:22
All right. Okay. No, that's not the song I want.

Unknown 21:25
Okay. No, I around. I was not very online yesterday. And I was just like, oh, guess something's happening. Oh, and then there was like, a three hour time period where I was just extremely online. And it just felt like no one is going to care about this. Right? Why is this? Is this just Nancy Pelosi being like, Oh, see, look, we tried. So you'll elect me again? Because I because I tried. Right. I tried. I tried. Because I don't understand how this is worse. I don't understand how this is going to track with people. We don't

Unknown 22:04
I don't think we as the public know that. It's worse yet. But I do agree with the idea that it is easier to understand that that that the fact that there would be this attempt to directly go after yet another democratic political opponent by seeking the help of another country. And people wrote down what he said in July. Right. And we say people don't care. Like who who won't care. Is the border. Don't

Unknown 22:34
read the news? Yeah, I mean, his supporters, people, I think,

Unknown 22:39
I think calling it I think finally calling it impeachment. Not only does that lead to is fundamentally different, there's still the six committees, they're going to work on this. And now, you know, you know, Maxine Waters is on the case, which is awesome. No, I think it's more that when you when you call it impeachment, you get certain powers you didn't have before right now, I was talking about this yesterday, when you once you call it in peace, when you have the you don't need to panel, a grand jury to do stuff, you now have abilities to do accomplish things. And the other thing and I'm again, I'm not selling this, I'm just trying to inhabit the point of view now.

Unknown 23:11
Yeah. So there's

Unknown 23:12
there's the one part which is calling an impeachment. First of all, it gives you I think, more more more powers, to do stuff without, you know, without having to go through the approval of the executive and stuff like that, because that hadn't worked out so far. And then the other part of it is that once it's called an impeachment, I think people will I think Johnny lunch bucket might pay a little bit more attention. But I don't know, you're probably you might be right. And I know you see, the thing is, I know max part of it. I think it's a superstition you have as well as like a bit and you you're so tired of being disappointed that you're like a little kid who's like, you know, my parents are never going to get back together. everything sucks. So I mean, I get that point of view. But I think you want also has to sort of look at what the facts are right now. And this has a slightly different barometric pressure than a week ago. I feel like, No, no, bring me down, bring me down off my cloud.

Unknown 24:06
All right. Now, let's make everybody sat down. But I

Unknown 24:11
think there's I think people, not you, Merlin, I think I think that people tend to Democrats or whatever, I

Unknown 24:16
read the same magazine articles that you do.

Unknown 24:21
I think people tend to get give themselves getting better Max, I think I think people tend to give themselves galaxy brain because you go on Twitter to read the news. And you're not you're sort of reading the news. And and that's why I'm Twitter because that's where the headlines are first. Yeah. But what you're also kind of looking into this like Hall of Mirrors where everything is reflected back into itself. And then you can't tell the reality from the perception, you're like, what should we do? Isn't this different question from what will people think? And you know what I mean? Like, it all becomes

Unknown 24:46
very will you start guessing what everybody thinks it knows? Or because that's all we have?

Unknown 24:50
Yeah, you're like eight levels, deep into the inception of like, just making a simple decision. And I would say, on the matter of impeachment, the way I felt about this, since the fucking guy won the election is like, it is should be obvious to everyone, including the Republicans, how history is going to look back and judge this moment. And sometimes things are sometimes people have power. It because sometimes you're just supposed to do the right thing, because you have power and not because it's going to get you more power. I always felt that about well, that this is famously what Obama said when he was doing when he was doing health care, right, you know, the economy collapsed. He gets in office, he bails out the economy, and then he spends all his political capital to do health care. And people kept saying to him, this is the wrong move, because you're going to spend all your political capital Yeah, and then do the same thing of going like, remember what happened, or what happened when Hillary did this from there when Hillary wanted to make the card and she wasn't even an elected person. And right, how damaging that was, and their historical precedent is, you know, 1992, right. And people kept saying to Obama, you're going to spend all you're really going to spend all your political capital to give people health care. And Obama said, what else is my political capital for? Like, I'm in this office to do this thing. Like, this is why I'm here. Like, there's no point he's like, if I what's the point of having the political capital if I can't use it for the health care like that's it like I'm here to do this right. So let's fucking go.

Unknown 26:09
And I'm not I'm not just here to accumulate and maintain power I'm here to do something.

Unknown 26:13
Right. And and ultimately, I think the vision became got got pretty fucked up because of these cowardly Democrats in the Senate, who ultimately could only do like a very, very incomplete and lame sort of version of health care, we wind up with this compromise thing, but because it was because it was like, people didn't understand like, we had control of all three branches of government. That's why the American people gave us the keys is they wanted us to do this and then you're going but if we do it, they might take away the keys. But like, yeah, okay, but then we're using the word going somewhere, right? They gave us the keys like let's fucking go let's drive somewhere that's

Unknown 26:47
what I've been. So that's what I've been saying for two years is like it feels like the the message behind so much of what's happening is if we use our power people will take it away from us right

now. Now one reading of that anyway, just so just to draw the connect the dots here, like the American people voted in a demo, a new class of Congress, that was a big Democratic majority, historically big Democratic majority. Like we have the house, the house, his job is to do impeachment. What the fuck are they therefore if they're not going to do it like it's obvious that it's it's it's leaving aside the Ukraine or this or that or the little back and forth? Like obviously the guy should be impeached? Obviously he is doing I mean just a minute it's the fact that there are literally the literally doesn't what Nancy calls other candidates for this that there are dozens and dozens of reasons that in any in any prior time, right here over just the hotel just just

Unknown 27:40
exactly. Saudis at the hood. Let's just even say Saudis at the hotels, pick one just go

Unknown 27:44
Yeah, I know. So anyway, it's just it just sucks to me. And it feels very cynical and lame that they finally got this like, Oh, we got you know, now that now it's the we've you know, now it's finally too much sir and, and and whatever, I'm glad we're there, but I do. I my worry is like we've we've so like, it's solely calculated and fake and weird that it's like the American people, it's just going to seem like politics. Like it's not it. We've lost the moment for it to be this, this genuine thing, but I don't care. Like as long as we're doing something, we're doing it but more I don't know. It's just also like, you know, listen, I here's the other thing I was thinking yesterday, I was going through the people who had already said they support impeachment, and all the candidates, that kind of cards had worked to elect a bunch of new congressmen and I've worked even beyond that on a bunch of campaigns. And all the people the card supporters who got elected and all the people that I worked for that got elected are were the first people on the lines for impeachment, right. So I should be all the Illinois delegation of Shawn Cason, chewy, Garcia, Lauren Underwood, all all the first ones up to say, yes, let's fucking go, let's do this thing. And did and I just, I mainly my takeaway for me is like I did, I felt a little satisfied by that, because I was like, you know, what, two years ago or whatever I was, like, outside, freezing my ass off, holding the clipboard, knocking doors doing all this work. And then now today, I'm reading in the newspaper that like that, that can that insurgent candidate that where we flipped a seat. Now we're actually getting to the place where where I want to go. And it was a nice, it was a good feeling. And so I would say like, again, this is only my my personal take. And people can take a ticket or leave it for what it is. But my personal take is like if you're scared or frustrated, or it seems like things are out of control, and it feels really bad. Like, I think you're very, very, very limited use sort of talking about it in Twitter and sort of like staring into this hall of mirrors all day. And I think you will feel much more in control of your own destiny and actually, tangibly make a difference in like a world historical difference in the course of world history. If you just go work on a campaign, you'll meet cool people, you'll get to get your hands dirty, you'll be you'll spend your energy doing something

Unknown 29:52
as long as you're still getting real data and not just relying on partisan reports. Just Just

Unknown 30:01
Secretary of State's site,

Unknown 30:03
just go just go do something like you it will feel it will feel so much better. You'll feel so much better.

Unknown 30:10
Sometimes the people I don't mean to call you a romantic because i don't i mean it in like a more old school, like classic sense of the word but like, but no, because, you know, like day to day in our in our day to day, it's sometimes the people, the people whose hearts have been most profoundly broken in the past who become the most cynical. And I think and I'm not saying this is you but I'm kind of saying is you know, when your hearts when your heart's been broken, like super hard about something you that you really loved or cared about where that was a tent pole and your understanding of the world when your hearts been broken that hard. And maybe even arguably, that many times it makes you skeptical, and it makes you you put up you put up shields for that. And I'm like that I think we're all like that, especially if you listen the chopper you become really broken inside. But but at the at the same time it does pay to be always open to the idea that things aren't what you think or what they seem or are at odds with your own consumption of it. So I'm you know, I, at this point, you're right, you're right. We're going to campaign for sure. For sure. I that's that's fantastic advice that not many people can super do all the time. But even if you're just an observer, I don't know. I don't know. I think it's going to be a you know what it is, man? It's the fucking velocity. It's the velocity of these last few days that tells me something's something is up. You don't get that a little bit. I don't very online. As of today, man,

Unknown 31:36
I think it's I think I am back online. I think it's a I just, I just, I'm trying to

Unknown 31:42
what is it? You're what is it you're trying to avoid? or What is he? Yes, I get the sense that you're trying to not do something,

Unknown 31:49
I'm trying to understand politics, I'm trying to, like have a conception of politics at a as a on a sort of a face value understanding. So what I mean is like, I'm trying not to have some sort of four dimensional dimensional chess of, Oh, well, this is that way, because this person knows this. It's I'm trying not to have that,

Unknown 32:08
that when you get night, then like, you're not that far from just being liberal q when

Unknown 32:12
I'm trying to avoid that temptation. And I would say I think that part because I feel the pull to do that. And I got really into that with the Epstein stuff, too. And I think, and I think part of the the temptation to be like, well, this is connected to that, because this person knows that and then they're going to do this. And then the American people will believe this, and then that will set them up to do this. And then it's all part of the mastermind. I think it's this this it is a very scary and bad feeling to have this feeling of nobody's in control. And the world is spiraling out of control. And having this feeling of someone out there Pelosi or the democrats or whatever. So Bernie, or whoever you believe in whatever someone's out there playing four dimensional chess. And if we can just get in front of the pieces, you're all part of the master plan. Like I think that's a sort of comforting in these times where where the I think the reality is that much closer to like Veep. And everything is just vanity and ego and contingency. And it's all just randomness, and no one's really in charge. And I'm just trying to understand that each person is just looking out for what's going to keep them alive, in the short to medium term, correct, that there's no sort of grand conspiracy, and I'm just trying to hold on to like, like, I'm trying it so instead of trying to, for me, and still trying to get my feet on the ground on some sort of complicated eighth dimensional master plan. I'm just trying to stick to like a simple moral truth of like, nobody should like die because they can't pay for medicine. Like, like, that's a very helpful place. Like if I could just say that 10 times to myself and like, and I know people have a lot of well what about this case where someone should die because they can't afford the medicine? Yeah. Okay, but but but also really well you don't hear see that on Twitter where so any if you if I right now, but any like saying, I go on Twitter right now?

Unknown 33:53
Yeah, I mean, like you need you need a you need a liver transplant because you drank too much. And it's not my job to pay for it.

Unknown 33:59
Okay, if I lost my

Unknown 34:00
I went on Twitter right now and said nobody should die because they cannot pay for their medicine. What about Richard speck? Do you know how many fucking jagged egg heads okay?

Unknown 34:10
Yes, but those aren't. By talking about the moral imperative, your those people are trolls. They're monsters. And

Unknown 34:19
but but a lot of people I agree or, quote unquote, experts on politics, their whole thing is, well, actually, I'm doing 12 dimensional chess and you're and you can't even say that because of these, this and that thing. And I'm like, okay, but also, like, it's also like, but also I do believe that maybe I'm wrong, but I do know

Unknown 34:37
you're not wrong. Okay. Yeah, my ain't never seen more sure about anything I've said on this podcast.

Unknown 34:45
There's, there's someone listening to this right now is actually Alex wrong. Someone should be dying, because they made some bad, who knows? But also, like, I just I know, it's right. And like, in the same way, it's like a Yeah, I know. I'm falling. I know. There's that. Okay. Well, the polls, he's looking at the polls and the the numbers tip that way, and she knows what the public opinion and it's this not unlike, but also like, there's just the more simple thing of like the guy. He's,

Unknown 35:08
he's like, he's violated the council. He's violated his oath of office. So many times the sickest part is the second part is we're going to look back and the one the books come out, it's just going to be it's going to be so embarrassing how dumb it all was. And Josh Marshall is going to have been right like there's, there's always it's always the stupidest, most venal, most gritty explanation.

Unknown 35:28
But it's, it doesn't need to be this whole calculus word. Now we can follow so you can finally move because the pieces on the chessboard are just in order to just a fucking do the, just go Just do it. That's what you're there for. And even if you lose, and he's not impeached, at least you tried to do the right thing. And that's sometimes that's just what you do as a person. It's not always because you know, you're going to win. That's not being a leader. You don't always go to battle just because you know, you're going to win. Sometimes you just have to do it. Because it's, it's the right thing to do. And that just frustrates me. Like the democrats aren't there so caught. They're like, we can't even do the right thing. Because what if we lose? Yeah.

Unknown 36:04
When

Unknown 36:06
you're right, Merlin like it's it's like, how many times have you gotten your heartbroken where it's like, wow, we might lose, we can't try to do the right thing. Oh, cool. I love I love to be on that team. We're not going to put our uniforms on and play because we might lose cool, what a fun team to be a fan.

Unknown 36:19
Yeah, we'll have to wash the uniforms. Anyway, every like, you go back to like what everybody says like, if you're wondering why nothing happens with with gun control, or, you know, common sense gun control, like after Sandy Hook, how could you? How could we get through, you know, I'm just I'm gonna pivot in a second. But people say like, after Sandy Hook, like, how could we go on living the way we lived after Sandy Hook. And now that's in the rearview mirror and like this, just another Walmart shooting, that, you know, a lot of people will say like, if we couldn't fix it, then we'll never be able to fix it. And I think for everybody's got their own example of that with this administration. And some of us have 16 examples of that. So you take something like Charlottesville, where it's like, it's just boy, just real easy dunk to say, yeah, the Nazis are bad. But instead you get the both sides ism. And then then that becomes part of the vernacular. And now we're just used to that. And now that's just a normal thing, that that's the kind of heartbreak I'm talking about. It's like, oh, man, somebody. I mean, it's, it's sort of like I said some about this the other night, and I don't know if practice and people off. But like, I was saying that sometimes my party feels like the parents who let their kids keep sleeping over with Michael Jackson, where, you know, your first job is to protect in some ways, like somebody, you know, the reason we have this particular form of governance, is that we don't want to all have to be our own Congress person every day. We it's a different kind of democracy where we elect people to take care of these things. And it's like, you're being a terrible parent. You're you're not protecting your family. Like when you when you refuse to run down the facts behind some of this obvious bullshit because you're scared you might lose power. You're being a I'm sorry, let's put it this way. By I don't know that that example, you're being a really bad parent. You're not protecting your kid. You're letting your kid get derailed by Michael Jackson over and over and over. Because you'd be in politic for us you to say please stop dealing my kid. Oh, and by the way, they can't sleep over anymore. But it's movie night. Okay, just tonight. And it's like Flipboard except in this case, the country is getting settled. And and I don't know maybe you're maybe you're like a like a stage dad. You're hoping it'll turn into some kind of dancing with the molesters? I don't know. But it's it's heartbreaking that somebody who knows better can go Uh huh. I think I'm going to weigh this and I think I can wait this out. I think I can wait this out. And that's that's hard to watch

Unknown 38:41
with with the also like, Can I like just the gun control debate is another interesting example of this of like, Democrats are a little too scared to sort of try anything like bold on gun control, because they're worried Oh, what do people get mad at us or whatever? What if we lose? What if we lose and then they will lose because they don't have votes? But like, I like gun control. Like Like, like there's a lot of very, like sort of the like low hanging fruit gun control stuff that's like, wildly popular, right? Like an assault rifle ban is just like, overwhelmingly popular in this country,

Unknown 39:10
especially while the NRA is the fucking Wizard of Oz, their little man behind the curtain right now. And we're still as scared of them as we were in the 90s. It's insane.

Unknown 39:17
But here's the here's to me, to me, the more like the more like like, like just this more simple, straightforward way to think about it, in my opinion is like you they should try to do gun control. And even if they fail, like it will paint a picture for the American public of who's on what side? Like let's just make it clear who's on what side and what are what do you get if you vote for democrats? If you've ever Democrats, they will try to do this wildly popular gun control legislation. And in the even if we lose in the long run, it's it's showing what we're about. Do you know how many times republicans voted to over to repeal Obamacare?

Unknown 39:51
No literal number? No.

Unknown 39:52
I like how many times do at least three right republicans vote to repeal Obamacare? successfully? They kept doing it even though they knew it wouldn't work? More than 50 times. And that's that's a in from Time Magazine. 2017. It is more than three. Yeah, the House voted repeal Obamacare more than 50 times and they just kept and they knew they weren't going to do it. But they kept trying and trying and trying. Because they understand power. And they understand like telling their voters like this is what we're about. We're going to keep trying until we get it. Even if we don't win.

Unknown 40:26
Do you think Pelosi in the history books is going to be guarded as a coward?

Unknown 40:32
I don't think in like the, if you were to say like, in my this is my opinion, like the more like the most like classical like what does a leader do? Right? They're like they like inspire people with a vision and they're out. You know, they're there. They're skating to where the puck is going to be and not to where it is. I don't think policy has really, she's she's not so great at that in her career.

Unknown 40:53
So a footnote not a I'm not trying to get I'm not trying to be like just a bitch like a coward. They're all bad murmur. But I think the thing that I find exhausting is even all the the identity politics idiot for a second like that's stupid fuck. Oh, this is gonna make people mad. I don't care. The river. Remember when it Don't make me send Richards back again?

Unknown 41:22
I know the Nancy Pelosi vote.

Unknown 41:25
No, no. Remember, remember the LGBTQ presidential forum that everybody was mad? Bernie Sanders wasn't at it was the most performed bullshit I've ever heard. And I watched the whole thing. And I was just like, oh my god. Oh my god. Do you think this is the brave thing you're gonna do? Is this what people are going to remember you for? Like, it's not there's no voting. There's no nothing. And yes, I did tear up a little bit when Elizabeth Warren

Unknown 41:53
has the significance of showing up at a panel with a special at a pancake party.

Unknown 41:56
Yeah, yeah. I mean, and at least Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker address the issue of all the black trans women who've been murdered this year and you know, talking about health care and stuff like that, but the rest are like yes, I support gay marriage. Welcome to 2008 Good job. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I it I don't know. I got a little I think I've been triggered Merlin. Oh, bye. All right.

Unknown 42:19
Well done. It's understandable. I mean, you've got

Unknown 42:21
we gotta say we gotta save this episode.

Unknown 42:23
Yeah. Yeah. Alex against gay marriage.

Unknown 45:31
She would she would break if

Unknown 45:35
I could do the accent. It's funny because I remember giving one of the products when I had launched in 2009. At the time she was talking about how she just started this website called goop and I was like, Oh, that sounds right up my alley. Now our products are sold on our site so it's really come full coming full circle. I know the self tanner is flying off the shelves because she texted me recently and says this tanning lotion is incredible. I can't believe the sales It's crazy. And so she's going into like people are becoming more educated about health and wellness and they're looking for different self care avenues and practices. And this is the part that we're getting down here skipping down to the part that teller screen grab a cocktail or friends. New PDS Do you both share any other wellness musts in your home America response we have a lot. We have the air purifier, we have the stickers you put on the back of your phone for radiation. I have the EMF detector that picks up the waves in the air. I had the whole house checked by a professional who looks for things like EMF waves and things like that. I even had something installed on my Malibu house to turn out all the power while we sleep. It's basically a button that turns all the power off except for the fridge and security cameras and the nighttime so when you go to sleep, you don't have any Wi Fi or electricity in the house at all. Almost a newbie says that's pretty serious. She says it's like going camping. I also have an alkaline water filter so I can pick the pH of our water. There's a lot of research on that. You don't want to be going to alkaline because you do need a little stomach acid to digest your food I typically choose somewhere around the 7.5 to 7.9 mark for the water. Then I like using Palo Santo to clear the energy in the space. And I also have little diffusers around what does she use to use Palo Santo to feel the energy in the space that is not a place wait for it, wait for it and I also have little diffusers around the house with essential oils depending on what's going on. We even mop the floors of hot water and eucalyptus oil, which is what my mother used to do is good for the wood and its antibacterial. It also smells really nice 30 so Palo Santo I had to look up

And you can support go ahead and say we know you we bore your listeners do by Friday program. You're probably going oh you know that's funny they've been they've been given us the real truth about how annoying Nancy Pelosi is voices and and about well, what are other takes about how we don't know which ways

Unknown 56:19
to make makeup?

Unknown 56:21
Yeah, she should smile more

Unknown 56:22
getting the kitchen and kick my dear. I'm Scott Adams.

Unknown 56:24
Yeah, we've been talking about how Nancy Pelosi should smile more and we've never heard we don't know what an Asian accent is your pardon? How do they have these brave? How could they even say these things because they lose all their advertisers? Well, that's the secret. We don't have any advertisers. Okay, there's no fucking Casper mattress is going to get mad at us and be like, Oh, you were canceling you for your problematic. You're okay. We're, we're we're just a two twisted, you know, our takes or two?

Unknown 56:50
Yeah. Where do you eat when you said that Jews aren't allowed to sleep on our beds? Yeah, the hate that. I hate to see it.

Unknown 56:57
Yeah, we're to our opinions. Were just too. too extreme. You know?

Unknown 57:02
That's the only way. So where do people go if they want to, like really make a difference?

Unknown 57:05
Yeah. Well, if they I mean, if you really want to do something you support it support the independent media?

Unknown 57:10
What kind of campaign or give us your fucking money?

Unknown 57:12
Yeah. And that's and that's the thing is that you have money and we want your money. And you can go to give us your money calm and you can become a $5 give us that. You give us the $5 every month, and that what's the I can't remember what the websites called having an annual you go to patreon $5. And and then if you do that we record all like another whole other episode of Dubai Friday. It's our after show. still

Unknown 57:38
gonna do that? Totally.

Unknown 57:39
Oh, yeah. No,

Unknown 57:40
no, no. And that's when we get really sad and depressed. And we really, you know, really become some really upsetting navel gazing. That's when we really just read out the things that allow that we've seen on Twitter

Unknown 57:50
really explain how Filmic Pro interacts with the gimbal.

Unknown 57:54
This week, we'll be covering how to build a pressure cooker so you can get that and more give us your fucking money that calm and finally are good. We have a little chat room for the Dubai Friday community and it is a really wonderful positive place it is a little Discord server and it's just for us and we've made a lot of rules so that people can't be nasty to each other. And some one of the nice listeners made I we struggled to tell people how to get to the discord. And so one of our very nice listeners made a sort of cool vanity URL so you can go to Dubai Friday club. And that will allegedly that will take you into the discord I checked it, it works. There you go. And you can you can go chat with us in there. We do have a team of volunteer moderators who are very wonderful and hardworking, and they are giving their free time to make that place. Very nice and positive and free of conflict and thank you to our moderators to do that. And also if you cross them I will destroy you. Your account will be will be banned. And we will ban you from the podcast you will not be able to

Unknown 58:57
do not defy the moderators.

Unknown 59:01
But I also do worry

Unknown 59:04
that the moderators might go mad with power

Unknown 59:07
but I'm just trying to speak the truth to women.

Unknown 59:10
I know I know.

Unknown 59:11
You're creepy. So you know a lot of people on the discord have put decided they put their pronouns and their username and then a very common mistake. People go on the discord and they go oh, I should do a bit about the pronouns. Yeah, that's that's the pattern right there. You're

Unknown 59:26
not funny.

Unknown 59:27
Not funny.

Unknown 59:30
Not funny. Not funny. Not funny.

Unknown 59:32
Not a good bit. What do you ever worried you think maybe the moderators might become mad with power?

Unknown 59:37
I think here's the problem. You talk to them too much. And you have you have given them power. I think they're just afraid of me because they're like afraid of being sexist or homophobic. And they're just like, oh, Alex wants something. We'll do it. We'll do it. Maybe I think I'm

Unknown 59:53
gonna stop using adjectives. Didn't the pope ask us to stop using adjectives?

Unknown 59:56
I am so confused. I am so confused

Unknown 59:59
Alex Ellis. I know we got a lot to do here but

Unknown 1:00:01
so can you me after show about the pope? Oh, we're already doing

Unknown 1:00:05
after show pop after show but I had one more resistance. Holy. Yes. Can I do it? Please? Yes, yeah, this is a tweet from yesterday. This is I went I was very online yesterday and I am one of the all time worst we see your cursor God you click or invalid. First, you don't want me to be at all the doctors, the doctors, you know there's a doc and now it's like, oh, you're clicking?

Unknown 1:00:31
Like more quietly. I'm trying to read a tale of two.

Unknown 1:00:50
I found one of the greatest galaxy brain resistance tweets I've ever seen in my life yesterday. So it is from Twitter. Well, I'm not even gonna send an email. But it's it's from all a sort of resistance account on Twitter. And she goes, this is from yesterday after the Pelosi announces the impeachment procedure and she goes Mark my words. So many babies are going to be born on June 30 2020. And Nancy will be a top 10 baby name. Thank you.

Unknown 1:01:19
Is the premise of this whole premise of this tweet is that when they announced

Unknown 1:01:22
the premise is the resistance people have sex which I think is a stretch.

Unknown 1:01:25
But it's just announcing that there might be an impeachment people get so horny that they have to listen, I can't even I can't even have normal sex. I have to like Raja Yoga and pray my

Unknown 1:01:38
wife, ki ki talking with more vocal fry.

Unknown 1:01:45
There's a challenge that we got to talk about. Why

Unknown 1:01:47
don't you send me this video? Oh no, this is awful. Oh no. With your with your fucked up hand. I hate all of this.

Unknown 1:01:55
So I just plug it into a monitor and then I play my apple arcade games and it's fine.

Unknown 1:02:00
Have you played on the Apple TV?

Unknown 1:02:01
Yeah. Or no, I've not played on the Apple TV.

Unknown 1:02:04
I played the desperation of the final Kingdom parts wherever the fuck it's called. I was playing that a little bit on my

Unknown 1:02:12
Sure Sure. Yeah.

Unknown 1:02:13
controller and everything was pretty Yeah,

Unknown 1:02:14
yeah, it's very, very good. I want to recommend Oh God, I don't even remember what it's called. But my new Zelda fix all those good. Um, I haven't played big Zelda yet. I've pretty much been playing the Syracuse game and cards of darkness. I said Syracuse son, and he got mad at me. Escape city was a challenge.

Unknown 1:02:37
challenge

Unknown 1:02:40
was Jesus Christ. Okay, no. Card hop,

Unknown 1:02:45
guys. Were an hour and you went to some advice.

Unknown 1:02:49
The challenge this week, which I think was mine was to buy a phone, but set it up. No, the thing this week was to is since we're all getting treats, when you get your new iPhone, set it up all the way from scratch all your life is all you're allowed to enter is your basic bitch stuff. And then like you don't pull over you don't pull over your app. So what

Unknown 1:03:11
did you I do this every time I get a phone so of course I did. I

Unknown 1:03:14
know. I know exactly how Merlin Did you do it? Not at all. Oh man. Alex Did you

Unknown 1:03:18
know I got so excited. I started to and then you started doing a stream I have I have I have. I have

Unknown 1:03:30
Well, okay, so did you

Unknown 1:03:32
see the new thing? Did you see the new thing that it can do? Holy shit.

Unknown 1:03:36
I did see the new thing

Unknown 1:03:38
through the through the little foam when thing and it got stuck on the panel.

Unknown 1:03:44
Wasn't it wasn't what I was trying to do. But that did happen. I need you to fix that.

Unknown 1:03:49
Merlin. I will paint you a word picture for that later. But a max did a live stream for setting up your phone is

Unknown 1:04:00
I had to do it. I had to do it and I thought the discord would it would enjoy seeing it and so I streams you get to peel your own plastic off. Uh huh.

Unknown 1:04:05
Yeah, I did. I did like an hour of just setting up the apps and stuff. I Well, I just thought people would want to see it.

Unknown 1:04:14
Yeah, I started doing it. And then I'm like, seriously, why am I doing? tools are so good.

Unknown 1:04:24
Okay, okay. See the thing? There's what it does? No, there, I just sent you the link Max, click the link in the text.

Unknown 1:04:30
You know how I was about to ask max did like I used to always do the encrypted iTunes backup and iCloud backups have gotten a lot better. And now there is you can just directly transfer the data from your old phone to your new phone over

Unknown 1:04:48
a discrete setup. You just set them next to each other and they make it their own little ad hoc Wi Fi network. And they transfer one to the other in mind with but tons of stuff on it took less than three hours from people. It's like an hour, two hours.

Unknown 1:05:01
Yeah, mine was a half hour.

Unknown 1:05:03
Can I give my read? It's not a reason I still it's I still did not do the challenge of my challenge. I did not do it. I did that. But I just want to say Why? Because in this instance, one of them one of my reasons for getting this was that my kids success is garbage. And it's bad, an old and the battery socks and rather than spending money to fix that up and I want her to have a cellular watch. So I handed her down my old xs and my old cellular watch like a new ones for me. Now. I have in the past. This is quick, but just for it's worth, I want to I want to tip my hat to Apple because the show has gotten so much better. Here's the thing they don't tell you. Let me start with one simple fact what they don't tell you what those fat cats in Cupertino don't want you to know is it's so easy to unintentionally fucking Bork all of your Apple Watch data historically. Like they don't tell you you know there is a way to backup your Apple watch you know what it is historically, appearing, comparing an Apple Watch whilst you have the original phone intact and the original watch in tech until maybe this year, the only way to make sure your data was retained because it was not going to the cloud. It wasn't it does now and this is huge. So it used to be big. Oh fuck I just lost all I just lost all of that. Because people think like you know, it's Apple, all you gotta do is like put these things together and it'll work great. Well now when you do this transfer your data thing it's not an excuse, but I want to like for once applaud Apple for really nailing it with this. You put the phones next to each other you do the thing with little you shoot the galaxy with the camera. You enter the past code on both devices. And then for transferring and then it says like hey, do you want to use the Apple Watch that you have pair with this phone on the other phone? I'm like shit Yeah, I do. Because now that's all in the cloud and it's on the phone. So anyway, I apologize I did not do I peanut butter hard.

Unknown 1:06:51
But

Unknown 1:06:52
kudos to Apple for this transfer your data thing I just still had a problem with it where I think he hit a button and had to start over. You can't resume you have to start all the way back over. But anyway, that's all I just want to applaud apple. Did you did you? Is that what you did Alex?

Unknown 1:07:06
Yeah, and I do periodically go through and just delete a bunch of apps. So I I didn't want to like fully immerse myself in the sticky peanut butter so like Twitter is gone all of my like Postmates and like all of the things that are theoretically bad for me I decided to get rid of just because why not? But I wanted to start playing Apple arcade games as soon as possible so I was like

Unknown 1:07:33
I'm disappointed in this max because because I really thought I was going to do this

Unknown 1:07:38
yes I'm very disappointed you guys I think you would have learned a lot from doing the challenge normally do this every year. It was very painless and easy for me you

Unknown 1:07:46
know I did do though, what you do, deleted all my shortcuts and deleted every goddamn shortcut because they're all showing up in the wonderfully improve share sheet and I'm like I don't know how to fucking get rid of these. I just deleted all of them. I'm going start over

Unknown 1:08:01
I did that I did shortcuts bankruptcy and so far I've only done done a couple of them. Okay. Yeah, we should actually we should probably do a shortcuts episode at some point because I have this stuff I actually want to do now where like I actually want a shortcut to like put things so I'm using things as my to do list right now and I want to be able to talk to things with the voice

Unknown 1:08:23
you're going to get Matthew castle a literal Boehner right now

Unknown 1:08:25
is really all it takes

Unknown 1:08:27
anything

Unknown 1:08:28
you because you can have you can have Siri so so Okay, so here's the situation I have Apple Car Play in my in my car now. And I can push a button on the steering wheel hugely, hugely improved, it's very, very good. And I can push a button on my steering wheel to talk to Siri. And so it's actually I'm starting to get more into what you can do with Siri over voice and there's some stuff that I want it to go into certain apps versus the default things

Unknown 1:08:59
no no, I think you're I think you're you're if I understand what you're saying and tell me if I'm if I don't you're you It seems like your potential interest in shortcuts previously was mostly academic or intellectual. And now you sounds like you're saying you can see how hooking this to that especially in the context of like voice in your car you are there are things that I would like to do and I would like to do that with my voice

Unknown 1:09:21
so like I want a big one is I use this app that James T green as far as I know kind of popularized this in the in the Mac nerd world called just press record to use that

Unknown 1:09:34
Yeah, I learned about that from serenity but it's really good

Unknown 1:09:38
while serenity got it from James Okay, how dare you And anyway, what I would love in the car is to be able to press the Siri the button on my steering wheel that that that activate Siri and then go and then say some sort of incantation for it to make a voice memo and just press record yet because I have an existing workflow to get my my notes to myself from just press record into my life.

Unknown 1:10:01
There's another very programmable app you might want to try that with called drafts.

Unknown 1:10:08
Draft stress does that dress as a button on my watch?

Unknown 1:10:13
Matthew Boehner What happened?

Unknown 1:10:16
I just I liked her.

Unknown 1:10:17
I know that you like bear I'd like

Unknown 1:10:19
I'm all I have it all figured out. Read a book Jesus. Bears so good.

Unknown 1:10:28
Like a dork PDF.

Unknown 1:10:34
Bears, bears.

Unknown 1:10:37
bears the bears bears the bee's knees.

Unknown 1:10:38
No, not so much. It's

Unknown 1:10:42
RTF for people who regard themselves as power users.

Unknown 1:10:45
Oh my god.

Unknown 1:10:49
I'm so tired of people demanding that I love bear and it's like

Unknown 1:10:54
I think we've actually found the

Unknown 1:10:58
pic the Notes app, like a fucking dork newbie, or get serious about Merlin

Unknown 1:11:07
doing what are you doing as an h1? And can tell because it says at

Unknown 1:11:14
the bottom of the barrel we've reached the bedrock of Merlin's like bad take. This is

Unknown 1:11:22
another episode of 2018 Yeah, you guys have convinced yourself you convinced yourself It's good?

Unknown 1:11:27
Because?

Unknown 1:11:28
Because it's the soy latte of apps right now and everybody loves it. That's totally understandable. Know what it looks like a good Okay.

Unknown 1:11:35
Okay.

Unknown 1:11:38
been using both drafts actually. It looks it looks fine.

Unknown 1:11:47
Wow. I used to

Unknown 1:11:52
get a Christmas tree this year. Let's just

Unknown 1:11:54
buy a Christmas card with a tree on it.
