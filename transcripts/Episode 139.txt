According to a criminal complaint officers found a toilet in the women's bathroom at the LAN community center clogged with a plastic bottle. Water was overflowing from the toilet. Obviously checked the restrooms the previous evening and the toilets were not damaged. It review 10 similar incidences beginning in April 2017 where toilets were clocked city determined it was like fucking nothing. The city determine each instance costs $200 in damage. That's it.

Unknown 3:11
What happened to the discourse?

Unknown 3:15
I'm so fucking angry. And I'm sorry. I just feel like this is just it's another fucking way that women and the people who pretend to like them. political reasons are ruining everything. Mm hmm.

Unknown 3:27
Wait, I'm not seeing where's

Unknown 3:28
this boy again, Sheboygan? Yeah, here's the thing. It's this has been such a journey for me because I used to hate it when people would would deliberately clog the public toilet but you know what I've grown? I realized that was privileged and I'm sorry, I owe them all he wants to do is called the lady starlet.

Unknown 3:43
It's not too much to ask. It's not it's really really highly not

Unknown 4:10

Unknown 4:27
I'm sorry How are you? I'm sorry you see now you're probably not as fired up about this because you probably make toilet wherever you feel like we need to make toilet Do you like go your boyfriend's house? like where do you Where do you go to make toilet?

Unknown 4:37
Oh, anywhere anywhere? I mean, actually, it was an issue for some folks in the office that we do have basically soundproof not even stalls.

Unknown 4:49
Bathroom grown undisturbed.

Unknown 4:54
It's okay really let it go. Ah

Unknown 4:58
this last little bits of fighter

Unknown 5:02
mud pies you got

Unknown 5:05
a slice

Unknown 5:07
it's got a little bit of a clunker at the end there. I just want to come out like some kind of a dumbbell. Isn't that sad? And so you soundproof the bathrooms which I think is smart.

Unknown 5:18
Studio really

Unknown 5:19
you got unisex or is there right?

Unknown 5:22
That's not what we call them.

Unknown 5:26
You say they are your

Unknown 5:42
Oh, I mean, we I have to say though we have been more aggressively taking them over with more. Like it started out with with just pads and tampons, you know, to make to make a statement.

Unknown 5:56
introduce new technologies.

Unknown 6:00
Get your cup cup you want to pour on Eric Trump?

Unknown 6:02
No, no, that is a more of a personal object. But we do have individual mason jars with different like the different scales of tampons if you will. Like there's light regular and heavy as well as organic

Unknown 6:21
get you like you get like an if you care brand tampon. Yes. Yeah, it doesn't do shit. It's coffee filter and fall apart. Just say you care.

Unknown 6:30
I call them the Save the Whales tampons.

Unknown 6:42
Oh, man, dog

Unknown 6:44
so soon. So who's without naming names? what's the what's the title of a person who refills the mason jars? Oh, notices and then we levels the resources.

Unknown 6:55
They are interns? I believe they're called hospitality interns.

Unknown 7:01
Sounds like such a euphemism. refer to them as the Joy Division. These are women who are very happy to be in service.

Unknown 7:12
Oh come on. Oh,

Unknown 7:19
boy.

Unknown 7:21
Today it's the worst night I've ever had is the the other day you know i open our bespoke fridge that holds our Lacroix kombucha and what is it Toba, Chico to pata ko the Chico fancy Yeah, to talk to you? Yeah. But I noticed it first I noticed the diet cokes that the cans had been replaced with bottles and I'm like, Okay, this is probably a one off thing like Mariano's didn't have Diet Coke. And then yesterday, I noticed there there was Diet Pepsi in there. Oh no. And I thought about

Unknown 8:00
it literally worse than a child sleeping.

Unknown 8:06
I was like, All right, let's take a second to think about it.

Unknown 8:14
pause for a minute and go like okay, am I ready? To make this the big deal?

Unknown 8:20
braver boldness that

Unknown 8:21
sounds that sounds like a fuck you from an intern in a kimono.

Unknown 8:25
Oh, I would not be surprised. That's such a fuck you. Oh, I am the person who I come sometimes I'm here either very, very late, or very, very early in the office. I'm kind of like a ghost. And that's usually when I go up to them. Like I'm so sorry. What's I can't remember your name. And I can tell now it's Brad.

Unknown 8:52
My name is Kathy Lee. I'm going to call you Brad.

Unknown 8:55
intern.

Unknown 9:00
At this point, though, they spelled with a lowercase I guess they signed

Unknown 9:03
a contract. I Oh boy. I wonder what sort of Oh man, I've actually prepared a my prepared a keynote presentation about all the different dongles that the people in the office might need

Unknown 9:20
training for this your whole life. Holy shit, all the preparation, all the montage sequences and you strapping USB cables to your boot.

Unknown 9:33
Oh boy, a

Unknown 9:34
keynote presentation about USB dongles?

Unknown 9:37
I mean, because

Unknown 9:40
let's say there's folks in the office that are a little bit older or they just aren't familiar with the new USB dongle lifestyle.

Unknown 9:48
It's so confusing Alex for us old it genuinely.

Unknown 9:52
Like is it a thunderbolt? Is it not? It's sometimes the thunder ball you can charge I'm still catching up on USB minis

Unknown 9:59
yeah the end like yes cable thickness doesn't

Unknown 10:04
matter what geographic for that slide or is it just

Unknown 10:08
yeah, it's it's just too there's there's that thin a picture of that thin us bc cable because it's not a Thunder Thunder Thunder about the Thunderbolt cable that comes with the new iPad pros and then there's one that is indeed thunderbolts that comes with the 80 watt or 85 watt MacBook Pro

Unknown 10:28
it's for its for throughput for more power to

Unknown 10:31
yes there's more power and it's yes and it is thunderbolts but the US BC and the like you know the little little skinny boy in the iMac or not the iMac the iPad pros those are not those are just USB see they are not Thunderbolt

Unknown 10:49
see this is ok but OK, so this is so boring I'm sorry hopefully max will save us Okay, so I'm looking at a USB CS I have some kind of Thunderbolt on this iMac 2015 I'm some kind of wonderful but I don't it doesn't have a quote unquote USB see as far as I know even my doc that I got at the time for docking was it I don't think it has a USB see but like in the like, like a Venn diagram but kind of like the Venn diagram like what is too little the little metal part that I would call the port of us bc you could like without breaking anything stick that into a thunder bolt

Unknown 11:28
yes by Elliot if are so confused we talking about that we're talking about the little like the skinny little circle not circles. What are those called? What

Unknown 11:45
ask an intern intern.

Unknown 11:46
intern intern what is

Unknown 11:51
the little little skinny ovals those are either us bc or thunderbolts three then that is that mutually exclusive? No no no no no no no no there's See that's what I was afraid of. No they're not they're not when the daddy the

Unknown 12:09
SBC like the more powerful one that's reverse

Unknown 12:12
thunderbolts is the more powerful one that's that's why with those shitty displays, you need thunderbolts and not us. Bc okay.

Unknown 12:20
Yeah, okay. No, no, I'm actually see

Unknown 12:24
this is actually my job.

Unknown 12:33
Oh, tampon choppers

Unknown 12:39
So anyway, you got unisex. This is what I'm saying. Uh huh. Uh huh. And I feel like I remember UOR

Unknown 12:44
saviors here Oh, thank god oh, I don't need to talk about girth anymore was

Unknown 12:49
it you were general trend somebody talking about PN on the sea problem was not a problem in the resigns what was it the cream that led to all the signs going up? The science? I don't remember Oh, like the passive aggressive wasn't trend wasn't trend when she was there wasn't trend on some kind of a journey or a mission that involves signage. Am I remembering that right?

Unknown 13:10
It was basically the like, please, please put the seat down brigade but then nobody realized that the cleaning folks were the ones keeping them up in Chicago. So really we were we were just being the tix

Unknown 13:27
this Hello, it's max. Hey, Max. Jeff break breakout star.

Unknown 13:34
Someone on Twitter was like, oh, last week was a good episode because max talked the most and no one interrupted him. And I was like, I agree. Finally. Thank you. I've always said that you can really great these episodes based on how many words it's like the debates, right? It's like

Unknown 13:49
if I'm if I'm a comment on this. Yes,

Unknown 13:51
please.

Unknown 13:52
All the time. I'm sorry. I've got to jump in. I'm sorry, Marlon. I've gotta jump in.

Unknown 13:55
Sorry, please. Yeah, you've been you've been invoked, you have 30 seconds.

Unknown 14:00
Like when Rachel Maddow like, points to someone that she's like, a quickly 20 seconds ago.

Unknown 14:06
My time is up. Yeah, no shit. Yeah. Look, I'm always saying each of us is pregnant with a better version of ourselves.

Unknown 14:17
Mr. Trump, I will meet you on that field.

Unknown 14:21
peacock feathers are created by peacocks eating thorns.

Unknown 14:26
Become a peacock feather two pounds. Oh, boy. It

Unknown 14:33
was that people were I think I thought that the deal was that people were pissing all over the seats like animals and they were leading seats up. And so for a while people would make these signs and they would say put the seats down exclamation point. And they draw like an angry emoji and they put it over the toilet. And I have always, you know, there's a great I've, we've talked about this before, but there's that great blog post by Marco about the Tumblr office. It's a all those things that I read it online and really lodged itself into my brain. And I think about it all the time. And it's what the paper towels and they said do not throw your paper towels on the floor. But the one thing they could have done to prevent it, which is put a garbage can where people were throwing the towels, they refuse to do and they just added more signs. So I've really, I've really let this idea into my heart. And I've sort of made a decree in the office that there will be no signs telling people what they can't do. And maybe the signs were if you do a sign, maybe you know, we have other ones over the sink that says do your dishes don't leave the dishes in the sand. And, you know, it's like, no one believes more as the person who has often done all of the dishes like before I go home at night, no one believes more strongly than me that everyone should do their dishes. Like that's not the point. The but but having a sign that says do your dishes.

Unknown 15:49
You gotta live No, no, you gotta live with that till somebody takes it down. It obviously doesn't work that's now become that's now become part of the office.

Unknown 15:55
Yeah, but also like, maybe maybe best case scenario. Maybe it works for one because people come to this thing. And they like, Oh, what's this and they read the sign and they go, I really should do my dishes. But then guess what, on day two, they don't even fucking notice it. It's not it's just never going to work.

Unknown 16:09
It's like It's like those the signs I told you about near my house where it's like, I still think about all the time and I was wonder if they're going to come back

Unknown 16:16
was it it was like 62 probes

Unknown 16:19
only these piles in the last month and they laminated it and shit. You know that that's never going to affect the people who don't read signs and follow rules. They're just going to think it's hilarious and RB also gonna be like, was a fucking sign yelling at me. Like it's it's, it's comical. But also, could it be a branding exercise? Would you be happier? If they did it? I bet they didn't like the wrong font. Right. So

Unknown 16:38
So I actually think that there is a good way to do this, which is I think, I think most people I mean, especially who like work in our office, they're essentially good people. And nobody wants to make anyone say, No one makes you want to make anyone feel unwelcome or inconvenience them or ruin their day or anything of that sort. So I think I always assume that if people are breaking the rules, if they're if they're leaving this seat up, they probably don't know what that means, right? That they're not, it's not that they hate women, and they're choosing to leave the seat up as a sign to disrespect women, it's that they probably don't know what it means to people when they leave the seat up. So to me a good sign is something that's like educational where it's like once you read it. No, I'm serious. A good sign is something that when you read it, it teaches you why it matters. So okay, so basically, the sign that we did put up above the toilets that I think was pretty effective at cutting the toilet seat leaving up was, we said, Hey, you probably don't know this. But when you leave the seat off, it makes the women in the office feel really uncomfortable and unwelcome because they have to touch your dirty toilet seats, it's covered.

Unknown 17:45
But that's concise. It

Unknown 17:47
doesn't succeed like a dependent clause.

Unknown 17:49
And so no, it doesn't matter and assign it's not a real

Unknown 17:53
time you're you're you're sitting there, you're sitting

Unknown 17:55
there being you're going to read it,

Unknown 17:56
how you're facing that direction. That's a good point. And

Unknown 17:58
so if you want know, you're not the kind of person who wants the women in our office to feel like they're not welcome, it's important that you put the seat down for those reasons, I think those times are effective. Similarly, Veronica, and I went to the Chicago Botanic Gardens last weekend. And we were walking around and there's a little spot that we like called the council circle. And it's this little hidden area, often one of the gardens and you can go and sit under this big tree and the tree there because it's kind of like around this little secret area of one goes to set. It's just covered in like, you know, those like initials where people carve their initials into the tree. And that's a similar problem to leaving the seat up, right, everyone wants to do it, and they're like, wow, how bad is it really this time? And maybe the Botanic Gardens even had a sign their own point that said, Do not carve your initials into the tree. And everyone thought, Well, I'm smarter than the sign. I'll do everyone else already did it. I'll just do it. So we went there this weekend. And there was a sign in front of the tree and it was hand written in chalk and it says there's no easy way to say this carving is killing this tree every cut into this sugar maple very thin bark slices directly and it can be him. The inner Burg that carries water and nutrients up from the roots and down from the leaves letter by letter. The maples vascular system is lost and the trees life expectancy.

Unknown 19:12
asylum,

Unknown 19:12
please do not harm cut or put graffiti on trees. I took a picture of that because I thought that's a hell of a sign. I bet No one's ever going to carve into that tree again.

Unknown 19:20
Oh, well. The people who read science won't.

Unknown 19:23
I think the biggest mistake though, when one is making a sign is to try to make it jokey because they're gonna like take a picture of the sign and put it on Instagram and never think about it again. I

Unknown 19:34
don't swim in your toilet. Yeah. don't pee in our pool.

Unknown 19:38
Yeah, yep, yep, yep. Yep.

Unknown 19:41
Those funny bathroom signs that people do where it's like a picture of like a half mermaid and a half bear and it's like we don't care what the fuck you are.

Unknown 19:48
Oh my god.

Unknown 19:54
You're half llama and one third squid. Share wherever you want.

Unknown 19:58
The first thing is I object to it. Like, it's just

Unknown 20:00
like it's a gender who understand.

Unknown 20:04
Or an octopus in your bathing suit area?

Unknown 20:09
Are you a crappy? They're not?

Unknown 20:14
Like, it's not that it's not that fantastic. Barbara welcome here.

Unknown 20:19
Like, but also like, you're kind of making too big of a deal out of it. Yes. Can we take it down to

Unknown 20:29
a nine and a half? I know

Unknown 20:30
you're on right now you're up here and I need you down.

Unknown 20:48
I mean, back when I used to go to offices for my nominal career at the time, I used to always be fascinated by ad hoc signage. And I participate in ad hoc signage. I've made a lot of ad hoc signage. I mean, I was somebody who had a copy of page maker, I did all kinds of shit. But it's always amazing to me think about that was that phrase desire paths, you know, where you can see where the people actually walk versus like where you thought the sidewalks would go. And it's so interesting, even in the best design places even at a Pixar you know, or an apple, you'll still occasionally see this. I don't know if they last for very long. But you can see where the intent of the designers and architects runs up against the reality of people using it every day. And then I always mean sometimes they're just trying to be helpful, like there will be like, Oh, you know, I just put the show notes that excellent Vox video on bad doors. Remember that? Have you seen that? Oh, yeah. It's not just you got doors are everywhere. How it's a very dicey planet. Yeah, but like it's a don't think it's done norm. I think Don Norman said it but talking about like, you know, the how what kind of handle is on it should be a cue for how to use it. But no, you get a door that's basically reversible. And then you put one sticker that says pull on one side, another sticker says push on the other. You can put seven or eight more stickers that say Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, and Peter, we're still going to do the wrong thing, because it's not intuitive. I think that's where ad hoc signage comes from a lot of the time is like, No, I just want to really help you like the bathroom is down here. It's look confused.

Unknown 22:10
The really good way to do the push polls to put the correct kind of handles on the door. That's what that's what he's saying. Yeah,

Unknown 22:15
yeah, exactly. Yeah. But I mean, you know, it's I don't know that kind of stuff is so interesting to me. Do you know anybody who's been to the Apple spaceship?

Unknown 22:22
I have not but I got confirmation that the are you talking about the anecdote where someone ran into one of the glass walls because I hadn't

Unknown 22:33
thought of that. But yes, tell me more about

Unknown 22:35
Yes, there was an employee who because the glass walls throughout the building are just so clean and so clear. They just ran into

Unknown 22:47
and then I've heard it's like yeah, I don't know if this is true or not but the story that I've heard is that it's like endemic that it happens like all

Unknown 22:53
yes yes. And even after like a few weeks of it, people are still doing it

Unknown 22:58
the well it happened to at least twice and then they just put post it notes on there and because the teams are kind of siloed Johnny would

Unknown 23:05
hate that yes,

Unknown 23:06
well he doesn't matter anymore.

Unknown 23:08
That was the story was that he was mad about the post it notes he wrote a memo but the people

Unknown 23:14
posted notes should be clear someone invited

Unknown 23:16
wasn't I want to go

Unknown 23:20
bad. I know it's going to be really I know that people say that it's going to be really boring and these are just offices but that's a lot you know, that's a lot we've seen pictures of a fucking like rock climbing wall that has water cascading down it like I just want to see that. I don't know like our desk truly are our office truly is a bunch of white desks and some people are standing and some people are sitting that's

Unknown 23:43
that should have more black desks. I thought for sure Lin Manuel Miranda took a picture himself at Pixar. And I can I can verify that they do have cute character silhouettes. I think it actually it says men or women's or whatever. But it also then we'll have like Woody will be you know there for the men's room and he's with his Mwana character. No Well, he's not the morning character. I think that's Chris Jackson. But still it's it's really not a good anecdote.

Unknown 24:08
The intersections are really the future

Unknown 24:09
Wait, I'm confused. Start from the sorry sorry okay,

Unknown 24:14
I saw a white Tesla

Unknown 24:19
awesome also my daughter made a painting Goblin um

Unknown 24:22
I have a question about this new hobby you have

Unknown 24:26
Oh the painting things I was talking about the painting Goblin and since she had so much fun bank offer painting Goblin oh good for her. Anyway, I want to say thank you for that max. It was delighted her unfortunately as I said in our private text channel, she did eventually become attached to the painting Goblin.

Unknown 24:43
From his artistic done she

Unknown 24:44
tried putting up some signs

Unknown 25:02
Remember, you are introverted

Unknown 25:03
do not

Unknown 25:09
remember the painting Goblin is not a person

Unknown 25:20
only work will set him free

Unknown 25:25
painting wow it's more fun to call him a goblin to make the Goblin well we

Unknown 25:32
don't say Goblin anymore. We say introvert artists horrific you can't make him super big and and I think they took out one of the qualities that was in that so here we're talking about something from the show last week where you were reading a very funny something Chan probably post about making a painting Goblin

Unknown 25:51
dear maybe Quinn should do one of those edits. Where do we do this on the show? Where

Okay, so you're saying book a cameo video from Jon Lovitz, and now it says This video is for someone else or myself. Should I say someone else or should I send myself notes to myself? Yes, and my instructions for Jon Lovitz are and then the example is, I'm having a tough week with classes and I could use some cheering up who spent $150 to hear Jon Lovitz way

Unknown 33:05
they want him to riff.

Unknown 33:07
Guess I thought this would

Unknown 33:08
be like I thought it would be like a jumbotron where you say my words, I assume shouldn't be a jumbotron?

Unknown 33:14
I mean, I guess we'll find out. Yeah, I'm good with you know, putting putting everything on black.

Unknown 33:20

Unknown 33:59
What do you say? Why don't you say I'm on a podcast called Dubai Friday. Could you read this sentence? Yeah. These these three words? Yeah, I'm trying to do it Tell him to do it as you know you can ask him to do it as the acting guy or Tommy Flanagan or whatever who

Unknown 34:13
act acting guy acting acting.

Unknown 34:16
called actually did you asked me specifically not to do that? That's the ticket guy cuz I think that's a little blade.

Unknown 34:23
Hey, john, I'm on a podcast called to you by Friday. Could you what could you say previously on Dubai Friday for us?

Unknown 34:31
Maybe as the critic

Unknown 34:32
Oh, interesting. Interesting. I didn't know what that was until I saw Simpsons your your bits or

Unknown 34:43
there was one time I just kind of went on a rabbit hole and watched a bunch of these because I was like, how how sad would this be to go public when they go up? A lot? Well, you put you put them up kind of as like a I guess, like a What are they called? profile? casting shot? What are those? A lot of them are public. Here

Unknown 35:04
they are no here they actually are. Oh my god. Oh, the soccer players in his car.

Unknown 35:09
Mm hmm. Okay.

Unknown 35:10
Most of them are from a couch or from a car or like from

Unknown 35:16
down to earth.

Unknown 35:20
Oh, I can check. Don't make this video public on cameo, which I'm going to do? Yeah, okay. Okay. And I'm going to Apple Pay.

Unknown 35:26
Well, Kareem Abdul Jabbar. I love that guy. That's the fight. He fought Bruce Lee in a movie.

Unknown 35:33
My request is booked. Jon. Jon Lovitz has four days to

Unknown 35:40
now the real game.

Unknown 35:46
Maybe we should edit this out, because it will be a better surprise when it happens. But I did. Mike did accept my ad. But an interesting twist of fate. He accepted the ad and he said it was very clever, but he hasn't invoiced me yet.

Unknown 36:02
Oh, boy.

Unknown 36:04
I'm getting real. I'm holy. Holy shit. You're the cop. Now.

Unknown 36:09
You give me the real worried.

Unknown 36:14
So much money. Okay.

Unknown 36:16
I had a situation where am I from my my, my dad was so good. I can't wait here my classes in northwestern, I had a situation where my bank account got disconnected from my student thing. And I missed and I missed a payment to Northwestern. And after a couple and I'm and I probably needed all the emails from them. So I didn't hear about it. And then after and then after a while, I got a letter in the mail saying you owe Northwestern $700. And if you don't give us the money, we will have a collection agency destroy your credit and come after you

Unknown 36:50
Oh, they're gonna flash them in and black thing you'll forget it.

Unknown 36:56
And they they they sent me a threatening letter. And so I paid them. But now is it possible for me to have that done to Mike? Oh, if you don't I owe you 700

Unknown 37:09
Oh, it's like a reverse collection agency.

Unknown 37:10
Does that exist?

Unknown 37:13
It's a reverse collection agency. You have you hired some thugs to go in and make someone accept your money. Right?

Unknown 37:20
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's like serving him. But with an envelope of cash.

Unknown 37:24
I think we could. We could hire fiber guy to do this.

Unknown 37:28
I think like if you're saying hire a guy for $5 Yes. Give him 1300 dollars in cash.

Unknown 37:36
No, no, you give this to my friend. No, no, no, give give him like a check for the original amount of the helmet. And then and then you're good. But you see where I'm my thinking, you

Unknown 37:49
know, but if he runs the ad, you're fucked again. You thought you're going to come him? I thought yeah. This is getting so much worse. You know, Mike is the

Unknown 37:57
alpha here.

Unknown 38:16
I've been busy. I didn't have time to send you an invoice. Also. I am Michael

Unknown 38:20
KO and I had some

Unknown 38:25
after you run around,

Unknown 38:29
Alex, I did you did you? Did you Merlin. Are you talking about your new podcast? I really enjoyed it. Oh, yeah. Talk about?

Unknown 38:34
No, no,

Unknown 38:35
no. I like Alex has a new podcast out. It's called two headed girl.

Unknown 38:38
All right. Yep.

Unknown 38:41
You can find it on Stitcher. You can find

Unknown 38:45
me listen to podcast.

Unknown 38:47
podcast good guy

Unknown 38:48
actually really helps people discover the show.

Unknown 38:51
And I really enjoyed it.

Unknown 38:52
We're kidding. But it's good

Unknown 38:54
work. Yeah, good work.

Unknown 38:56
I say the max one of my takeaways is it's so interesting to me that you're certainly not as confused as I am. But like this thing is still confusing for you to like, I got I got from that, right.

Unknown 39:07
Oh, yeah.

Unknown 39:08
Yeah. And you were just like, Oh, yeah. So

Unknown 39:12
curl up into a ball and you're like, I'm sorry.

Unknown 39:17
very upsetting thing is the number one piece of feedback we've gotten is Wow, you guys talk a lot. And I'm like, you guys. Do you talk a lot? Yes. Yes. What? Yeah, I don't know what. How to respond. Other than Yes,

Unknown 39:33
my wife I talked about what color to paint our daughter's bedroom and I want to say 2009

Unknown 39:40
you talked about the cat and the cat thinking

Unknown 39:43
oh god the cat. Yes. Yeah.

Unknown 39:45
Merlin. Is your cat

Unknown 39:46
still alive? I know I know a couple I know a celebrity couple celebrity ish couple and they do they are very very fucking communicative but they also have like an annual summit where they like all the things and they like have like an awesome site and the kids aren't there and they like there's no cats there's no kids there's no TV they just talk about shit instead of like instead of just like sending each other pictures of the cat sitting on thing

Unknown 40:10
oh I see like their own couples therapy type thing

Unknown 40:14
kind of but like they're I think they're both super into it is like like here's here's the stuff I wanted to get done that I could use more support from you

Unknown 40:25
know every

Unknown 40:26
it's like a deliberate intervention you call in yourself

Unknown 40:28
every every six months

Unknown 40:30
and what other ways have I harmed you with my ass? Oh

Unknown 40:32
no, but like every six months, six months matchy and I go to like a fancy dinner and we bring out our checklist of not like our grievances but like okay, what should we get done with the house? Like what can we improve with the apartment? This like this next quarter? Like how should we divvy up like grocery shopping? Not even allowed

Unknown 40:53
to hang a picture that

Unknown 40:56
you love to have walls?

Unknown 40:58
We were like a bed

Unknown 40:59
yet me? Yes I want to

Unknown 41:02
fire reasons I rather you didn't have walls

Unknown 41:04
Do you still sleeping on a nest of clothes?

Unknown 41:09
These doors are firehouse

Unknown 41:10
Oh man. Well we do think like we do make a checklist and a calendar of like what things we can ask the landlord and when because we don't want to bombard

Unknown 41:21
Oh, you gotta time that shit out for sure.

Unknown 41:22
Exactly. Like all right, let's talk about the broken door November start with the second

Unknown 41:27
most important thing because you don't want to square the deal and all the other ones like

Unknown 41:31
actually Exactly.

Unknown 41:33
too trivial because then he gets to feel like a hero. Oh my god. Exactly. Yeah,

Unknown 41:36
first, because we're going to do the broken closet door first and then we are going to do the broken locks.

Unknown 41:43
Oh, what I wouldn't give for a broken closet.

Unknown 41:50
Oh, man did a max I was expecting follow up from the debates.

Unknown 41:56
Um, nothing follow up from the debate. So we watched him at the office. I had a pretty fun time. I don't know I for me, I don't think that anything changed in my view based on debates me my father things I thought.

Unknown 42:14
It's like saying, well, this person is the best a roller skating roller

Unknown 42:21
skates. I mean, I think the one that in sort of in terms of like political out, you know, fall out or whatever. I mean, obviously, Biden took a big hit and polling and this is inevitable, like, the more Biden has a bit of a Hillary Clinton problem. And yeah, the more people see if they like him, and

Unknown 42:38
it's always it's always been like that you just you just sit around and wait for his own goals on so it's just saying something so stupid. And then being really arrogant about like, not admitting that it was a stupid things

Unknown 42:47
I felt that exchange with Kamala Harris was it was a really extraordinary. I mean, I watch a lot of debates and I have to say like that's going to go down in those like clip reels is one of the all time great moments in American political debate,

Unknown 43:02
because you could tell he been trained to like sit it out and be a gentleman about it, but then he couldn't keep it in.

Unknown 43:08
I don't know. I I was I have to say I was impressed by Kamala Harris. I thought she was clearly came off as the leader of that debate in her in her sort of conduct. And I just, I sort of thought that I would really not like her like, the more I saw her speak and stuff. And I it's quite the opposite. The more I see her speak, the more I do like her. But that being said, policy wise, on both nights. To me, it was obvious that everybody like it to everybody was just it was the Bernie Sanders debate. We had two nights of the Bernie Sanders debate.

Unknown 43:43
Well, the Bernie Sanders over two years ago debate, right. It's kind of the Elizabeth Warren debate now, isn't it? Um,

Unknown 43:50
no, I don't think so. I think it's I think everyone is talking about everyone is saying why I agree with Senator Sanders plan or I don't agree with Senator Sanders plan. There everyone is, in fact, I mean, look at how much the party and the national discourse have changed as a result of this one old dude running for

Unknown 44:06
president now you're known I'm sorry, I didn't mean to sound I just I was reading that Harrington article yesterday about his yelling and stuff on

Unknown 44:12
that Harry an article. I read it weird, weird Mojo to it. Yeah, it had a weird I agree. It was it was I just should that guy really be that confident about like calling the polling, like, it's just can we learn anything from history? But But that aside, there was a new ABC poll out today that showed that Sanders gained huge ground after the debate that he's only a couple points behind Biden now.

Unknown 44:33
I mean, it's like this is I mean, I know he's not a 530 anymore. I think he's at the New York Times, or see, no, he's a CNN, but like, you know, part of what I love about 530 it's shit. And I, you know, I understand why people don't like what they do. But part of the reason I like what they do is, I think they're smart about segmenting things, and segmenting all the things waiting all of the things. And it's like, I want to know what the people who don't vote think, like, I'm not really interested in the wine mom perspective. At this point. I am not interested in the person who dreams of becoming a minor kind of perspective, I want to know about the people that aren't that are difficult to reach and didn't vote last time didn't vote in 16 or 18. Because that's that's going to be it's all going to I think, I don't know fuck all about politics, but my gut is that that's going to be the story is like, can the democrats bring out the people who don't vote? Right?

Unknown 45:22
Yeah, that's that you're you're absolutely right. It's like the there's also

Unknown 45:27
Joe Biden, Joe Biden, but he's gonna slowly erode support until he melts into a gelatinous ball. Like, it's all gonna be, it's gonna be a lot of up and down. Like, you know, Kamala Harris now that she's, she's back in big, we're going to hear tons about the shit she pulled around here when she was a prosecutor. There's gonna be a lot of that up and down, back and forth. Right? But But you know, but like, what isn't that I mean, isn't that the thing Max is like you always like you always say that I think is really smart. Like, stop trying to get David Brooks to vote for you. It's stop worrying. Don't spend time and money on that spend time and money on turn out for the people who are affected by the policies that can cause a huge difference but for whatever reason, or register or don't vote.

Unknown 46:06
There was a Chapo this week it came out yesterday it was I fucking I mean, it was such a good episode and I'm so I'm so great. I know. I know. We talked I know I said it's all john Russell syrup. Man. I'm so grateful for that show.

Unknown 46:19
JOHN Russell sera farmer

Unknown 46:20
there are days when when listening to trap house is the only thing that makes me feel like I'm not losing going insane,

Unknown 46:28
isn't it? It's weird that they're bleakness can bring me so much. Yep. Yeah, it

Unknown 46:32
just brings me like sanity.

Unknown 46:34
Felix Is this the one we're Felix had the total meltdown. This is more Felix had the meltdown. Yes, yes. It was so fucking good.

Unknown 46:39
So they were reading these these two different op eds. It was David. And one of the other Brett Stevens right. And they both wrote the same op ed, which is democrats better move to the right to get my vote. And it's like, what your vote What are you what like we already First of all, like we just ran an election where which I'm just saying which opposite, but we just ran election where we tried to get moderate Republicans to vote for us. Yeah, thank you. Guess what, it didn't fucking work and Donald Trump is president. And the problem is if we move to the right to get the three op ed columnist to write about this kind of shit, the vast majority of Americans who are non voters will literally never get out of bed, they will not care because you're not offering them anything that will help their lives, like the most, like centrism,

Unknown 47:19
centrism and moderate stuff is not going to be a huge catalyst for bringing up the folks that are going to make this a meaningful election. We

Unknown 47:26
just have to remember most Americans didn't vote for Trump. Most Americans didn't even vote for Hillary. Most Americans didn't vote because they weren't offered anything that was worth voting for they slept in. That's if you want

Unknown 47:38
to win the election, they need more good wallpapers

Unknown 47:43
want to win the election? Let's figure out how to get those people excited. We don't need a single republican. We don't need to become a little bit pro camp to get the republicans to maybe consider voting for us. That's not the way anyway, what are we talking about the debates? Yeah. The debate is I think, you know, just just remember the lesson from history here is like in this stage of primary in all stages of these primaries, you get real flavor of the week syndrome. And flavor of the week syndrome is it's a big field. And there becomes this sort of media obsession and fans, that people that changes, you know, month to month, week to week, I think we had a mayor Pete season. Remember when Mayor everyone was talking about mayor, I was he I blew the whistle on Mayor p very early and I said this guy is going to be a big player in the election. I know you don't like him.

Unknown 48:31
Oh, I mean, I Oh, no. I do not like Mayor Pete. No, he's he's he's boring. And

Unknown 48:36
I'm glad to have him in, in blue.

Unknown 48:41
field but but yeah, we had an airplane o'clock your toilet? season. And now I think we're definitely in Elizabeth Warren season.

Unknown 48:49
Oh, are we not in Harris season? Well, I

Unknown 48:51
can post debates where it's probably Campbell, heresies. Okay, it's probably Kamala Harris season come I think we might have even had a Joe Biden a sort of Joe Biden moment around when he got on the race where there was I saw a lot of Joe Biden mean, we had a

Unknown 49:04
Joe Biden generation and almost generation of fucking job by more than a generation, a generation of Joe Biden pass

Unknown 49:10
the torch.

Unknown 49:12
Max, you know more about the leadership and like the the politics of the politics, but haven't we learned that electing or having a vice president as a candidate doesn't usually work out?

Unknown 49:28
I have to say, I think there's a lot of this is sort of a real cable news deck tie sort of type of prognostication where they're like, Did you know The taller candidate always wins? And, or like are there like sitting vice president or on all his own party has never been elected? or this or that, or at

Unknown 49:47
this point, white men who don't like milkshakes have only been pulled at 9% have a very small chance?

Unknown 49:53
I don't I have to say I bread sheet. I don't think any of that is it matters. So much more of a Nate Silver EMS. I think it's an interesting pattern. I mean, I keep it's like a thing that I'm I'm aware. I know it is out there. But it's like, you know, it is true that in the history of American politics, the taller or no, I'm sorry, since televised. Since television, the taller candidate has always won every election. Does that mean that? Wait? Yeah, so so since TV, the taller candidate has won every election, I

Unknown 50:26
feel like I knew that.

Unknown 50:29
I was really. And as a short American, I was saying, I'm really I'm really happy that Hillary's gonna win. Hillary's gonna wipe the floor with Trump because it will break this pattern

Unknown 50:39
that glass ceiling

Unknown 50:41
height ism in presidential politics. Oh, I mean, it's not gonna be breaking the glass ceiling. It's more of like getting a step by

Unknown 50:50
step ladder to get the glass.

Unknown 50:57
Like clean the glass.

Unknown 51:00
What

Unknown 51:02
does that mean? So we know that it's true, including the Trump election, the tall essence TV that is whenever the election, does it follow from that, that we should always nominate the tallest candidate, right? Yes. You know what I mean, like, because there is a certain logic to that right of like, well, maybe we should be getting nba stars to run because they'll be taller than Trump. And then and then we'll win

Unknown 51:23
next, would you click on the link that I just said, please?

Unknown 51:25
Well, what I want let's see if this iPad is capable of clicking on a link

Unknown 51:32
turns out Oh my god. Oh, I love this. Oh,

Unknown 51:37
yes, this is Yeah, tell us what we're looking at Merlin I love this.

Unknown 51:40
I just it's the first return that showed up for what I accidentally search terms in correlation and causation. It showed in graphs and it's just it's just this idea. Well, everybody knows correlation is not causation. And even there's turns out to that where it's like, Yeah, but sometimes it does. But this is just a bunch of uncannily strange graphs about can't seem to correlate number of number of people around by falling into all

Unknown 52:05
correlates with films that Nicolas Cage appeared

Unknown 52:09
Oh my god, it's a staggering

Unknown 52:10
oh my god this was very upsetting this this should be really you know, if you're gonna get the singing painter when they're done with that bring this one up. per capita cheese consumption correlates with number of people who died by becoming tangled in their bed sheets.

Unknown 52:23
Wow, look at Wow, the age of Miss America. Stats Don't lie. The age of Miss America correlates almost one to one with the number of murders by steam hot vapors.

Unknown 52:40
Dead by curling, I really

Unknown 52:41
feel like this is a fucking like Thomas Friedman column generator.

Unknown 52:52
The letters in winning word of scripts National Spelling Bee correlates with the number of people killed by venomous spiders.

Unknown 53:12
Anyway, I just it's all my way of saying like, like, I don't know, the whole Curse of the vice president thing and illusion of Biden was the best candidate with the best policies. I don't think the curse of the vice president thing would apply to him. But there's some Why does that but then I think you could ask what's the underlying reason of why why do you have that curse? And it's like, well, maybe that the previous incoming vice president isn't inherently defensive position where they can never, you know, they always have to defend the past and stand up for every mistake that was made in the past and they can never come out and wipe the slate clean and say, You know what, I was wrong. Nothing was wrong.

Unknown 53:46
But history can be important. Because if there's anything we should learn from the last three years, it's that nothing unprecedented happens.

Unknown 53:55
So anyway, and I

Unknown 53:58
say make a painting Goblin.

Unknown 54:01
me. I was nervous.

Unknown 54:03
This is my personal feeling after watching the debates. I think it's got to be for me, it's got to be Sanders. It's got to be Sanders. Like I think that's the way that the chap Oh, I'm sorry. I think it's the way forward. It's your second choice. Marissa.

Unknown 54:17
They love her so much.

Unknown 54:26
Hey, why did you how did you meet? Always what's going on with that, Alex?

Unknown 54:30
Oh, wait, that was Merlin. What what? Hold on what's happening?

Unknown 54:34
Sorry. Did I see a photo of you carry always Is that something that you said? Did he say as you wish?

Unknown 54:39
Yeah, no, no, but he did talk much more than expected. Good, actually. RO he's not so good. Not as good as Matt Smith. But like real close. Yeah, I'm actually a

Unknown 54:51
nice nice

Unknown 54:52
he was a little too nice. Like I actually don't know. He's got like the job Johnny Depp thing going on where like he there were many people taking selfies with him. And like he was like, above the waist above the waist above the boob and let's do the shoulder. But his

Unknown 55:13
very odd

Unknown 55:15
coloration on the anecdote. Didn't want to touch boobs.

Unknown 55:19
No, I'm saying

Unknown 55:21
Johnny Depp was there and he

Unknown 55:22
touched a boob you were saying hi. So I like so I like Bernie.

Unknown 55:25
Carry always out. Who are you excited about today?

Unknown 55:29
Yeah, excited about the debates. I mean, it was really fun to Rachel but she like Rachel she's great hair she's

Unknown 55:38
know she's incredibly attractive. Um, but

Unknown 55:45
this is just

Unknown 55:47
just coming in right now.

Unknown 55:54
Throughout the entire script tonight.

Unknown 55:57
The entire script is started. It's one of those nights.

Unknown 56:01
Oh boy.

Unknown 56:03
Do you like from the debates answer the question or

Unknown 56:06
Oh my god.

Unknown 56:08
30 seconds morning answer the question. Please address your question. 30 seconds go.

Unknown 56:12
Oh, I've always been just a reminder you have 25 seconds left.

Unknown 56:19
Ah, Harris was really fun to watch. Still, like if I could use it would be Warren but I think Bernie Sanders is the only thing that'll get people out of out of bed

Unknown 56:31
out of hell world.

Unknown 56:32
Let me say I have a couple. I want to give a couple of quick thank yous. I twice in the last couple weeks. I've had some sort of technical problem that was right in Merlin's wheelhouse. I had

Unknown 56:42
such a nice time with you and our visit the other day, it helped me so much did it Really? Oh, I had no idea. You could do that shit. Okay, so it is right.

Unknown 56:50
Yeah. So so I had to Well, I'm going to give the first one which is so I had to sort of small like little technical things. And I thought if I didn't know, Merlin, and I wasn't his friend, I was just listener, Merlin's podcast, I'd be sitting there at home with this problem going. Boy, I wish I knew Merlin because he's probably the only living person who's thought up who's so obsessive about this exact specific topic that he has the right answer. So the first one was I wanted to get a dehumidifier from my basement. guy

Unknown 57:21
had one man for this job.

Unknown 57:23
And I thought who would know? And I thought, How do I get a dehumidifier? And is it even the thing that I want? And I and I texted Merlin, and within 10 seconds, he sent me the exact product I should buy and told me how to plug it in and the whole thing. So thank you, thank you for that. Yeah.

Unknown 57:36
And it's got the hose attachment, which is nice.

Unknown 57:38
I haven't I have to say it's sitting on my Amazon cart. I haven't pulled the trigger on it. It's a little costly. And I'm thinking about it. And maybe I'll get it this week. And and then on the other thing I had, well, I don't know how much detail you want to get into. But I had a little file. I was trying to organize my magic videos and get complex. And I wasn't sure what the right sort of,

Unknown 57:56
yeah, we figured out we figured out how to make a smart playlist. Yeah,

Unknown 58:00
it was very, it's very cool. I have a whole I have and I'm using and I set up a Hazel rule for myself. We It was very productive. I really solved the shit out of

Unknown 58:08
it. I really I talked about it. I mentioned on back to work that would have fun. And what a fun time that was. Well, you're very very welcome. You know, the whole world of the consumer humidity and air marketing just

Unknown 58:21
fine fire file system hierarchy.

Unknown 58:24
And file systems. It's all very complicated.

Unknown 58:26
You know, Merlin, I just be remembered for this one thing, which is just under thinking about file systems.

Unknown 58:33
Like I really do ask I asked for so little, you know

Unknown 58:39
really depressing.

Unknown 58:41
Oh boy did Dig Dug Should we do the challenge? Let's do the challenge.

Unknown 58:48
Oh, and thank you also, I also had a problem so I was dealing with my magic DVDs all weekend. And I was ripping a lot of DVDs and thank you also to Casey lyst who I asked KI new cases he has this crazy workflow of of

Unknown 59:02
he's kind of he's he does this analogy thing Why

Unknown 59:04
don't want to say copying I don't want to say Casey takes his blu rays and then puts them he archives on his computer sick Martian plaques because that I'm not sure if that's legal. But he he doesn't do that. But he knows a lot about it. And so as Casey was like, is this the right thing? Am I doing the right thing. And he sent me back he vomited out such he sent me a 50,000 words on like DVD best practices for like DVD codecs and stuff. And at the end, I am implementing a system but also I was like, Casey, you have to publish this, like you know so much about this. And it's so good the system you figured out so hopefully I I hope Casey I think he said he's going to try and do a blog post or something about this and put it up. But if anyone has that problem, definitely consider the the list method once it's posted, because it's fucking cool.

Unknown 59:51
Yeah, that's one of those things where like, it does really help to have a Sherpa or a rabbi or whatever, because like, there's so many ways where like, you don't want to go I mean, I've noticed stuff where like archived media that I have on my Plex, like one thing will play fine in the LG Plex app that doesn't want to play hardly at all on the Apple TV app could be a beta thing, but But in any case, like it you do really want somebody to and in my case, I learned a lot too, so yes.

Unknown 1:00:14
Did you know that MKV is named after Russian nesting dolls?

Unknown 1:00:21
Yo,

Unknown 1:00:23
whoa, holy right. That is really

Unknown 1:00:29
Oh, man. That's Oh, that's so that's so cool. I don't know why I'm so excited about that. But I am I just never thought about what you know, Casey, he's

Unknown 1:00:39
on this podcast. What

Unknown 1:00:40
Apple Oh, he didn't install the beta so Really? Here's the

Unknown 1:00:45
challenge challenge.

Unknown 1:00:49
Berlin It was your My challenge this week. Oh, yeah.

Unknown 1:00:54
Yeah, I mean, we don't talk about it but um, what was my challenge and it was too I get a listen I have to admonish everybody not to do this because we had to do this because it was for our work how to do it you had to do it but was the to put an iOS a an iOS 13 beta onto one of your devices that you wouldn't mind having it on. And then to I had I mean, for me the genesis of this was well of course I've done that because I'm an idiot but also I i in talking to Alex and texting with Alex I had so I have had so many questions about stuff and I I saw this as a time to to learn from Alex's wisdoms, but that everybody was everybody. Challenge.

Unknown 1:01:32
So. So Max,

Unknown 1:01:34
I am using the iOS public beta on my main production. Number one. Apple.

Unknown 1:01:46
Dang. Oh, yeah. Oh, boy.

Unknown 1:01:51
That's exciting.

Unknown 1:01:52
Oh, it's right here. A big iPad. Got it? Oh, look, I dropped my iPad in the street. And I smashed it and I didn't get Apple care.

Unknown 1:01:59
Oh dear. Because when I when

Unknown 1:02:00
I bought it, they were like, you want Apple care? And I was like, no, what do I look like an idiot Who's this man. And I just dropped I was at the marijuana signing bill. And I was trying to look cool in front of some politician and my, my bag just like spilled open. iPad comes crashing down into the pavement smashes. So I replaced it and I got a big screen iPad. How do you like the big boy? Um, you know, every so often I'm like, maybe I should try the big iPad. And then I'm like, I don't love it. The normal iPad is the correct size.

Unknown 1:02:32
But every so often I get it. And I'm like, maybe this is the thing? Well,

Unknown 1:02:35
yeah. And also not not to jump too far ahead. But you know, I mean, the thing is, if you want a big iPad, the older, bigger, bigger, bigger iPad is actually kind of better. Like if you really want to use a keyboard. That's part of the cover. That's that one is better. I mean, I got the bridge for the big one that the now current big iPad Pro, and it's I hate I hate it is no fun to type on. Whereas now not to jump ahead, but I always 13 makes the smart. What is it? Alex? What size we're talking about? If I don't say the wrong, less

Unknown 1:03:05
living inch? No, it's a little bit called.

Unknown 1:03:07
There is nine point something.

Unknown 1:03:09
No, no. Are we talking about the regular iPad? That's Yeah,

Unknown 1:03:12
seven. Yeah. Um, it feels like you get I mean, the the compression of how the real estate is used is so much better. Now. It feels bigger than it used to, even though it's the same size in your hand. You know what I mean? Like having all the icons tighter together. And

Unknown 1:03:29
at least in my experience, it feels real good to use on that size.

Unknown 1:03:33
Am I making sense? You know, icons and stuff. And yeah, it's easier to move stuff around with your fingers. I think this is what what size? Are you using a 911? Car? The big that's not the big one.

Unknown 1:03:45
I it's also my main and also only iPad. I know it's the smallest iPad Pro. Okay, yeah. Cuz, you know, it's it's I I went, I went there and use my main main device. I actually surprised you. Don't you put it on a baby. I haven't an old things.

Unknown 1:04:06
Okay. Yeah. I

Unknown 1:04:09
mentioned my friend of the show.

Unknown 1:04:11
Oh,

Unknown 1:04:12
yes. You called out I think on multiple shows. We're having I have it on everything to I have the dev beta on my iPad,

Unknown 1:04:20
because nobody else our listeners aren't allowed to do this. But like, it's fine.

Unknown 1:04:25
I don't think they need it for their work. No, no.

Unknown 1:04:28
My main reason I did do it only for the challenge. But I stopped doing the betas. And the reason is yes, you know, apple, this is my personal reason Apple releases new hardware every year ish. And I usually get it at least a new phone when it comes out. And to me what I've realized over the years is a big part of getting the new phone is the new iOS like the

Unknown 1:04:49
you want to feel fun and fresh.

Unknown 1:04:50
Yeah, exactly. The hardware and the phone doesn't really change that much year over year. But to me, like what's cool is getting the phone gets faster, and it can run the new iOS really quick. And yeah, it's fun and funky. It's fun. It's a fun fun to be. And I want it to feel fun and fresh. And if you put the iOS beta and you get this big, slow, clunky beta on your old thing, and then you get the new thing.

Unknown 1:05:09
And then by the time I see what you're saying that because then by the time it does come out, you're like, well, I don't even remember what's different about this.

Unknown 1:05:14
Yeah, you're like, this isn't so great. What do I have a new phone now and it does all the same things as my old phone like it's like saving a little gift. You know? It's like unwrap it. You could listen I'm a I'm a grown ass adult, right and people give me a gift Christmas presents and I could open them anytime I want but I save them for Christmas.

Unknown 1:05:31
I feel you why because it's more fun to do it on Christmas morning. More fun. I agree. I agree.

Unknown 1:05:36
Why did I do this? Oh, my story is so contorted but like it's it's as I God, here we go. Silly season. This will be on the next reconcilable differences will come which comes out next week. But um, and we did talk about betas and running them. But like I accidentally went down a path right asked for Alex's help about what I need to put this on. I was just going to put it on my very, very old junky by better bro. That's old, old old and not the cool new one. But not know. So that's how I ended up getting Catalina my computer which I do regret. Hmm. Then I thought this so this obviously when I was waking up this morning thinking about this challenge. And I realized like I am so bad at this. I'm so bad at this because I do the most rash things. With something like a beta. I have it in me to do rash things like this. But then I become incredibly timid. So like, for example, I haven't converted all my notes and reminders. Because I'm like only one work with me family, and all that stuff. So I don't even get all the fun out of the risk that I took. Are you all in on stuff like reminders and notes and what there's new reminders?

Unknown 1:06:39
Yeah, they're welcome to reminders all new, completely rebuild app to makes it easier to create creation. What does it do now?

Unknown 1:06:47
it you can have like nested sub tasks, and it looks more like a mid things. Yeah, they they made like baby Omni focus. I guess. I'm kind of disappointed by it. I know. I know, Marla. I know. I know.

Unknown 1:07:06
I know, I know. I'm listening.

Unknown 1:07:09
By the dip the updates to reminders.

Unknown 1:07:11
Yeah, I thought they would have a little bit more depth. But you gotta there's too much poking to get into what you want in terms of like sub tasks. And you don't really have like an inbox. I want an inbox. I'm an inbox person, because then I put it all in the right spaces. And yeah, it's it's fine. I guess we'll have to see when everything is not like I am waiting until the public public beta three to put it on matches phone. Because right now it's totally broken. And I have to deal with notes. Notes. You can have nested folder, you can create them on iOS as well. Like before, you couldn't do it on iOS. Because reasons, I guess I don't know.

Unknown 1:07:55
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

Unknown 1:07:58
And I, I don't know, I'm not a huge fan of notes. But that's me. I don't dislike it. I'm writer die for bear.

Unknown 1:08:06
Yeah. Am I moving that bear lifestyle?

Unknown 1:08:08
The thing was, it was some of these things is

Unknown 1:08:12
I don't know. I mean, this is not particularly exactly your main tool to the challenge. But it is a funny balance to say like, Okay, I need this level of power. And I need this level of simplicity. On the other hand, I need to balance that in a way that's sensible to me, like I will give up this amount of under simplicity to get this kind of power, and vice versa, in some cases. And so like, and I'm not trying to be that guy, but like, that's why for me, I still love test paper. I wish test paper was better supported on iOS. At the I get weird second problems with Dropbox these days, where it's for some reason stuff is maybe because the Catalina is not always getting duplicates and stuff like I hadn't normally but like, in my case, like, you know, reminders is good for reminders. It's good to remind me to take something out right? at a certain time. That's really good for that as far as task management. For me personally, like that's going to be test paper or that's going to be like an index card or a notebook. It's just it's like it's it's, it's not smart enough to it's not smart enough and powerful enough to be that fiddly. Yeah, it works with Siri, which is nice.

Unknown 1:09:18
It does. And that's the thing until like, there's no beta for the home pod, which bums me out. Because how can you like break a home pod you know, and that maybe when that is a thing all use it more, I don't know. It's great for our shared shopping list, which is now broken. So.

Unknown 1:09:39
And that's I mean, that's part of this is that, you know, one thing that so funny, what we used to doing windows about is now the thing one of the things we find most valuable about with Apple stuff is the integration like used to be so creepy to us Mac users that Microsoft and windows in particular had so many conduits into all these different places. And it's so creepy that they weren't sort of firewall off. And now today, that's really one of the primary values of using Apple stuff in some ways like iCloud has come so far. And I mean, like you, when you're if you are doing this iOS 13 beta, you're going to see so many different things that are like, Okay, this family thing has been enhanced, the sharing thing is easier now DVD, all those kinds of things, which I think is really smart. They want to see their growth and services where they realize that's the best opportunity for growth isn't services. And so it makes sense to have the hardware and the software like make that better and easier. And if you're not fully committed to being timid about the stuff that would, in my case, screw that up with sharing with family, you know, you're not seeing the benefit until it's really done.

Unknown 1:10:41
I'm curious, you seem very bothered by people telling Blake publicly saying don't install the betas and IY does, it seems like there is a bee in your bonnet, as you'd say.

Unknown 1:10:55
I think it's I think it's actually extremely good advice. And I always ruining my other podcast. But there was a very, very, I don't think I said this here, I'm pretty sure it was a Syracuse set. But there's a very funny tweet. And that is emblematic of why almost everybody should not be writing betas.

Unknown 1:11:13
Which is the guy who was like

Unknown 1:11:16
anybody else getting a forum for trying to install the profile?

Unknown 1:11:21
Come on Apple, what a terrible rollout. And it's like, really, really sit with that for a minute. Really? Because what do you say, Boy, if he had done what I had done?

Unknown 1:11:33
Where's my tree? Yeah.

Unknown 1:11:36
You suck up the thing that's not out yet. And then you go to Twitter, and you do a search. And I really do see at least two sides to this for sure. You go to Twitter, do a search and say like, you know, iOS beta profile for, uh, for and like you'd see. That's how I found his tweet. Is everybody complaining about it? So like, he has the in curiosity, this isn't still about the quality of Apple software, as he's mad that he can't install the beta. It's like, guess what, dude, like you're a pretty good candidate for maybe this is not right for you. Now, the other hand, you get somebody like Alex, I'm not even sure I know how to follow radar. But you're out there giving direct feedback, which is why they put this out there. I'm having fun with our dear friends whom I love very much. Because I don't even want to say because I don't sound like a dick. But it is it is everybody has their reasons for saying that. And I'll say that I'm honestly I can say for sure. like legit, like, yeah, if you're gonna be traveling, if you're going to be doing stuff if you if you know if there's never a good time for your ship to stop working. If you are thinking about running a beta, I would say consider doing, first of all do the public beta, which is still no guarantee, but do the public beta on a device that you could afford to to go terribly wrong. And even with all that said Syracuse would advise you not to because what if it screws up your iCloud data and you don't even know it for weeks. So anyway, I'm having fun with our friends because it is it's sometimes funny that when you get to say it's for my work, it has this two sided thing to it. When you say oh boy, don't anybody else run this. I'm a developer or I'm person who writes and does media. And there is something kind of funny about being a person, especially amongst our media, friends, whose job that given themselves is to do reviews of betas that they're going to talk about and then tell people they shouldn't do the beta because it's not for their work. And it is it it's just it just kind of fine to me. It's good advice. It is good advice. And you'll go but it also it just adds that element of danger of like, Oh, I can handle this, but you can't I have to handle this because I have I have the tough job of writing about betas. I just think it's kind of funny and a little bit privileged to do that to like say like you're not allowed to get in on this fun because you're not you're not ready for it. And and you're not playing at the level that I'm playing at where you can handle this kind of risk is how it feels sometimes

Unknown 1:13:46
it feels like a brag It feels like a brag to me I like when you make the iPad go the long way and then your widgets come the that's my favorite new iPad is cool.

Unknown 1:13:55
It's

Unknown 1:13:56
very cool. Quite a quite a while. But I don't like that goes away on this mode. Let me have it on this one is adult Yeah, yeah.

Unknown 1:14:05
Man, let me get my bad job, Apple.

Unknown 1:14:07
I can say I'm a

Unknown 1:14:08
grown man. I know. I know, say

Unknown 1:14:14
on the toilet, and I know how to deal with widgets.

Unknown 1:14:16
I know I know that they're sitting in their in their glass circle and they go well, if we let the user put the widgets on when the iPad is the long way, it'll make their icons too skinny. And you know what, I'm a grown ass adult. Let me have the icons. I know it's gonna make the icon skinny.

Unknown 1:14:33
It's okay, but now the icon stay where they should be. And

Unknown 1:14:38
I know, I know. I know.

Unknown 1:14:40
Which is a better that is a better solution that the I it was it was it was always a little bit of bamboo under the fingernails that I could never learn where the fucking icons were on the iPad. You had to learn it two different ways. Yeah, it was a little disorienting. But yeah, man I'm a I'm a grown adult

Unknown 1:15:01
will make the icons going to

Unknown 1:15:06
be somewhere and not move. I'm a grown man. Let me

Unknown 1:15:10
let me let me let me run my own iPad.

Unknown 1:15:15
maybe don't have it on by default. That's what I'm saying. Oh boy. Which by the way the other thing is a non by default

Unknown 1:15:21
a lot of things aren't on by default like the can you do with this other than put the widgets on

Unknown 1:15:25
also these widgets are straight up broken. The

Unknown 1:15:28
widgets are about other things.

Unknown 1:15:30
The the when you go in the long way and the widgets load incorrect lyst on widgets. Okay. Anyway,

Unknown 1:15:37
Max is a grown man is the point of

Unknown 1:15:39
this. Let me ask you this. What widgets do you have on your iPad? Or your iPhone that you enjoy? I'll say can do a few. Yes, yeah. fantastico has is the king of calendar widgets very good. And you have to do the full calendar view I really enjoyed the deliveries app This is a straight out of the Merlin man playbook but I have delivery I have some Gmail filters that send all my nonsense to delete is it all gets automatically ingested by June cloud by June cloud and then it puts it in deliveries and I can see where my my Amazon my kitty litter is. I have a the nest brand thermostat at the office in my house and I use an app called thermo watch thermal watch gives you nest controls on your watch but it also gives you a really cool look at this widget Alex these are all this isn't all the thermostat office and I can change the temperature of right from my iPad

Unknown 1:16:28
if I want we can do a Mr. Robot you can heat everybody out of there

Unknown 1:16:32
and I have I use carrot whether I think they have a good weather widget whatever widgets oh there's just press record has ever I don't have this on my iPad but on my iPhone I use that almost every day. What other widgets you guys use them

Unknown 1:16:45
on my phone? I have shortcuts. Water? What's it called? A water reminder? Zero which is zero. It's this keto thing. And then what else Oh fantastic hell clock which are I'm sorry not clock kill zones, which is by underscore David Smith that tells me if my friends are awake in different countries and then working to another country. See

Unknown 1:17:15
Mike

Unknown 1:17:16
you I mean? Oh, okay. A lot of people in other countries. No, no, you didn't like the friends you were traveling abroad? Like if you're scheduling a guest for a show like

Unknown 1:17:28
you can you You poor bastards are in such a weird time zone. Like I feel like no,

Unknown 1:17:33
no, no. No, no.

Unknown 1:17:39
Central Time is the main zone. The central IT HAS central right in the name. It's the main one. You're fucking too early. No, wait. Yes, you're to New York is way too early. Where the fucking Goldilocks Okay, all the TV is on. And guess what? It's on exactly the right time for us.

Unknown 1:17:55
Yep, yep, it is. Okay, um, I couldn't wait for Game of Thrones. And I also you right now it's broken. But I'm on the dev or I'm sorry. I'm on the post beta on my phone. And normally I have timer a live there which is a time tracking app. All right, yeah. But with my iPad, what do I have? there? Most of them are when you got good widgets. Pretty much the same on my iPad. Oh, draft suit. Yeah, there we

Unknown 1:18:23
go. Yeah, draft dress has neat stuff for that. I mean, I don't think about it as much as I should. I have I think I've got

Unknown 1:18:32
or you're not living the widget lifestyle.

Unknown 1:18:35
I mean, I might eventually it's kind of cumbersome to spend a lot of time because I think it's kind of cumbersome to go through the process of deciding what should be here and there's stuff I really wish were there that can't isn't there or currently isn't there that drives me nuts but I've got I got some weather good weather underground I got deliveries I got a calendar there what I wish was there was ring I wish I wish it was easier too because like you currently doesn't matter that's what I wish was there

Unknown 1:19:04
then you could see who was at your door eight or nine minutes ago

Unknown 1:19:06
you can't do ring with you can't do ring with Amazon routines yet and it's frustrating.

Unknown 1:19:11
Oh you're still doing that.

Unknown 1:19:14
I know is

Unknown 1:19:15
rule What are you talking about?

Unknown 1:19:17
I know I don't know. I

Unknown 1:19:18
said master to relax the

Unknown 1:19:20
rocks.

Unknown 1:19:22
I morning like we're

Unknown 1:19:24
pretty much a home kit household

Unknown 1:19:29
look down on my Alexa with that nonsense. I

Unknown 1:19:33
yeah, we're all we're all fucking home kitted out. Everything works on home kit. I can't have home kit fucking turn the lights on tomorrow.

Unknown 1:19:40
So much it'll theoretically eventually be able to do

Unknown 1:19:43
I know I

Unknown 1:19:44
have that I make I make that thing fucking sing and dance. And it works great. And and here's me from clear across the house and orgs

Unknown 1:19:49
Oh, no, that part's fine. No, no, no, it's like it's it's like a I don't know. It's like having a golden retriever with excellent hearing.

Unknown 1:20:00
it'll, it'll hear everything and do practically nothing.

Unknown 1:20:02
I will say I was practicing a, I was in my basement. I was practicing a card trick the other day where I needed to produce I had up I have about in the trick. I have about two to three seconds to produce any named card for the trick to work. And I have to kind of do it while I'm like talking. And it's very, you have to just have

Unknown 1:20:19
to get like split you got like split your attention.

Unknown 1:20:21
Yeah, it's like a 10,000 times thing to kind of make it real smooth and make it work. And so I was I was trying to figure out how do I practice this without having a person there who like names a card and all of a sudden I got a little idea and I was like, Hey Siri, game a card. And Siri was like I don't see any artist called car shut ups here a series stop. Series stop. Is that really series stop? Yes, it's okay. And then I went and then so I and then I so then it just it was like Oh, I'm sorry. I don't see an artist called card and Apple Music or whatever. So then I was like, fine. It's not going to do it. But then I was like, Alexa, name a card and Alexa just fucking did it.

Unknown 1:20:58
Let's roll dice. Alexa. Sorry.

Unknown 1:21:01
Alexa, stop.

Unknown 1:21:03
Alexa, name a card.

Unknown 1:21:06
It can't hear you. Can you Merlin?

Unknown 1:21:09
have it go? No. Um, anyway.

Unknown 1:21:13
We'll get more excited about more time with it. There is a lot of stuff going on here. As with TVOS, it's going to be interesting to see like what what

Unknown 1:21:25
can you can use make Alexa do a card?

Unknown 1:21:30
Okay, hang on. This is great. This is really good.

Unknown 1:21:33
Great audio

Unknown 1:21:34
turning up. Alexa, name a card.

Unknown 1:21:40
card is the queen of space.

Unknown 1:21:43
Merlin, Merlin, what? Look under your mouse pad.

Unknown 1:21:50
always had a mouse pad.

Unknown 1:21:54
What's going to be interesting, I noticed this with TV us we're like right now. You can do picture in picture inside of the TV, but it's not in other places. And I don't know the answer to the question. Like who will choose I can see a lot of places not wanting to adopt that. God there's so many reasons to not want to make that terrible TV app better for people or make TV OS better for people. I could see Netflix saying Well, fuck, you know, why are we going to do that? We do not want you watching our video in a little postage stamp while you watch something else. So but and I think that that extends to all so much of this the power of what could be coming for as long as it's just really, really just improved. Really good. well crafted stuff. And then the rest of about like who will adopt this in what way there's there's so many things in the ecosystem. I'm sorry, I'm not putting as well as just making any sense. Like, it's a lot of stuff in iOS 13. Like so much stuff in the apple universe is an excellent idea that not everybody will implement in the same way. Right? All the apple stuff you can count on doing that way. But like if you want to continue to use any kind of other stuff that's not an apple thing. Like, you know, how will that work? And I had a recent example this that I'm failing me at this point, but anyways, I like it. The using the mouse is a nut is a nutty thing. It's

Unknown 1:23:04
crazy. I love it.

Unknown 1:23:06
I love using a mouse.

Unknown 1:23:08
That's why would you use a mouse? Mm hmm. What else does this thing What else should I do? shortcuts? shortcuts.

Unknown 1:23:15
Okay. Well, actually, no, you should not touch shortcuts until it comes out because it is very broken in a way that is shortcuts already out. Yeah, yeah. It's it's just this there's some sinking issues that are like there's some sinking issues. And then if there's

Unknown 1:23:33
what's the most use shortcut that you have on your iPad?

Unknown 1:23:38
to text Maddie to birth that I am home and that what?

Unknown 1:23:45
Hold on Mother's mouth sounds are in the text back. Maddie Burke.

Unknown 1:23:50
Okay, okay, hold on, you're coming home, that kind of thing. How much?

Unknown 1:23:54
How much more work? Is it? Can't you just open up your thing and be like, I'm home?

Unknown 1:23:58
The Well, I'd say that but I just say it to the thing. And then it triggers a bunch of stuff. And then it does the lights. This

Unknown 1:24:06
is why I like my Amazon routines.

Unknown 1:24:08
Yeah, but you got it. But what happens if you can't talk to it? What happens? What happens? What happens if you if the Wi Fi is out?

Unknown 1:24:16
He's a why the Wi Fi going out is something I deal with eight or nine times a

Unknown 1:24:20
day. I want to quit the answer to my question.

Unknown 1:24:22
I said that's the numbers. I know you didn't answer it. What does it do? It? Okay, what does it do? It sets the lights to exactly the way I want them. Which is

Unknown 1:24:33
it so mad. He's home?

Unknown 1:24:34
He's home. No, there's two. There's two instances. I'm coming home and I am home. Okay,

Unknown 1:24:39
so you're so mad. He's wrong, right? Yes. They're there watching TV. Yeah, waiting for Alex to come home. Yes, you come in the door and you're like, hey, dingus tell man. No, no, he turns all the lights on?

Unknown 1:24:50
No, no. Okay, when I

Unknown 1:24:52
play like, like heraldry, like,

Unknown 1:24:56
actually, some will sometimes I will change it and shortcuts is really my prank machine. Um, but the sounds like a great hobby. Yeah. It's fun. Um, and then also, like you You can do this with, you can do this just with home kit, or you could do this with with the echo, and just say I'm going to bed. But it turns like everything off it turns on my like little soothing playlist onto my home pod. And then it sets a timer for when it's going to go off. Or like when the home pod turns off. Does that make sense?

Unknown 1:25:33
And that's that's the key is like finding the itch that you particularly want to scratch even if it's not interesting to other people.

Unknown 1:25:41
Yeah, and there's a there's a whole bunch of routines I'm making now that are like, with a timer. Like there's a specific thing so it's

Unknown 1:25:52
a real pain in the ass to like, remember what I want. You know, what

Unknown 1:25:55
I want is what I want is every week Alex sends out the Edit of Dubai for and it's a it's a text message and in the text message is a URL that's on drop. Oh, can I was on hold on some sort of shortcut that Yeah, I can do that link and make it

Unknown 1:26:12
Oh, no. That's not possible. I've tried. I've gotten a nap. That's not I can't listen to the episode and in overcast, there's no shortcut to put it in there.

Unknown 1:26:23
It would be like would it be like Apple script like messages is not very friendly to that kind of stuff. Like we wanted the thing of like, Oh, go go pull out all of the links that have been mentioned here in the last eight days or whatever. And it's I don't have an easy way to do that.

Unknown 1:26:36
Yeah, there's there's also no easy way to upload anything to overcome. I mean, I'm sure you can do something with like keyboard Maestro or Apple script.

Unknown 1:26:46
Astro would be better for that.

Unknown 1:26:47
The Oh yeah. Because there's the siloed Oh,

Unknown 1:26:53
Walsall grommet house with this Alexa thing do I yes you build a wall some drama house where you're trying you're like

Unknown 1:27:00
I want cheese grommets

Unknown 1:27:03
fucking thing starts playing the radio and cooking this is bad how it starts cooking your bacon and I don't know it's weird

Unknown 1:27:10
I like to I like to wake up to the smell of bacon just accept

Unknown 1:27:15
no this is these are all totally you know what I want one for the for the lower one the going home one is to also say arm my alarm and it doesn't currently support that

Unknown 1:27:23
I mean if I had an alarm

Unknown 1:27:25
can say it but I don't want to say two things I'm not a monster

Unknown 1:27:28
I I see well no no

Unknown 1:27:30
see no use and what I've done here Max No Oh yeah, I'm turns on turn on my lights sets my lights to the setting that I want it turns on KQED at the volume I would like and I have to say is morning lights.

Unknown 1:27:43
You know what would be good as if I could do one that would play over the most recent podcast and overcast but I don't think I can do that.

Unknown 1:27:48
Yes So can what wait what on the whole home with home home pod on? Yes. If you have if you have created a shortcut Hold on. Let me go.

Unknown 1:27:58
I would do that if I had one. That was like Good morning and it turned on the lights.

Unknown 1:28:03
Morning.

Unknown 1:28:04
Good morning, Max. And yeah, I want them my British I want my Jarvis to say good morning. I wanted to turn the lights on in my bedroom. And then I want to start playing the top podcast and overcast on my cereal. All right, hold on. I don't know if we have this technology. But if you can rub my balls that'd be great.

Unknown 1:28:27
The balls a little bit too hard. That's hard. I gotta work today.

Unknown 1:28:30
I think the Japanese have this technology.

Unknown 1:28:38
You tried to send me the Baltic or from Japan it gets destroyed by customs
