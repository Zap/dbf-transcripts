Unknown 1:15
things to do in Vegas when you're dead.

Unknown 1:19
You're not on the instantaneous gram. But he seems to be hanging out with Matt King, which is the guy who eats goldfish. So well. Those are English words in a sequence See, but that's the problem is that is an accurate true sentence I said and I wouldn't Matt gold

Unknown 1:39
no matter what a Mac

Unknown 1:40
Mac. Oh, maybe. Okay. Wait, did

Unknown 1:44
you to understand this? This is not a slam on you. I want to find the goldfish boy.

Unknown 1:49

Unknown 2:04
I interesting question. I don't know

Unknown 2:07

Unknown 2:18
Oh my god.

Unknown 2:20
A little bit. No, no, no, no women. If Ken Jennings played a Tom Wolfe impersonator I cannot

Unknown 2:27
see it. Wow. Look at that. Look at that. Oh,

Unknown 2:30
he is he's a delightful man. I'm wondering what this is the show. This is la Hey, Jordan. How Cameron Have I been entered? Wow. No one's looking at me. Nevermind.

Unknown 2:43
Oh, no. Are they rebelling? None of them are looking

Unknown 2:45
at the

Unknown 2:46
answers become self aware. But since dad's

Unknown 2:49
gone I guess I'm just

Unknown 2:51
fine. You're the Conrad Lauren's Now gather them ducks baby.

Unknown 2:57
Goodness,

Unknown 2:58
while we entertain this before I'll text him

Unknown 3:04
to be nowhere to be it's it's boys it ever silly season.

Unknown 3:09
I've noticed that I the first time in maybe 10 years or five years. I don't know this is gonna, this is gonna make me sound like a happy person. But I texted the two of you and didn't get a response. And I was like, Oh, no one's answering my text. And I was like, whoa, whoa. And like, you know, two seconds later? I'm like, of course not. Max is like, I'm literally like watching them play games with famous people. And Merlin has a child and I just wanted to let you know when when did you do this? Why don't I don't remember I just recently you know that you are appreciated. Again. It was like point five seconds. But I was like, Oh, I cherish the relationship I have with my friends.

Unknown 3:51
Oh, I do too. I cherish it much I you know, I think about it a lot. How? I mean, I like I have text relationships with a handful of people on a daily basis. You guys are probably just about because max creates a lot of new groups. Yeah, sometimes max gets on a little bit of a tear. And he makes splinter tear off groups. Were like with an increasingly large or small number of people that I know that I'm included in. So like sometimes he puts things in this channel. First of all, my sense is you guys don't talk to each other except through this channel. Because you talk a lot about things like buying camera lenses. And I say do you need me for this?

Unknown 4:36
I never. I have maybe instigated this once.

Unknown 4:39
CI you're being very touchy.

Unknown 4:41
I see. I am why you said why you said

Unknown 4:50
you hate men.

Unknown 4:55
Just because we do all the crimes and make sex on you.

Unknown 5:00
We're no Oxford commas in that Manifesto. So that was settings.

Unknown 5:04
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I really noticed that. There's that one. There's the one with Jen. That's about survivor plus whatever max wants to put there as well with Jen and Kevin. Mm hmm. That sometimes he puts things in there. So yeah, there's no so really you guys. There's one with my, my, my wife and my daughter. JOHN Cusack pretty often. That's mostly my big ones. I text Roderick to see if he remembers we have a show literally every Monday at 10am. Do a little jumping in with Todd boys who was next.

Unknown 5:42
Oh, I forgot about the one Dr. Dawn. That's it done. That's another one. Oh my god.

Unknown 5:46
And there's the one that says the Dream Team, which I don't. Oh, that is That's right. That's that's Kevin and, and and Jared con.

Unknown 5:54
It's Jennifer con. It's confusing because you only get two faces. So I imagine if I'm seeing this maxing this and this is probably why he puts random weird Twitter links which he doesn't look at anymore. Random weird Twitter links could appear in any of these. That should be gray. Here's a weird one. Here's a weird one with Dan Benjamin and Jason. Fifth president says that's a very strange

Unknown 6:19
dad is interesting.

Unknown 6:21
I think Jason has recently discovered the show and the inscrutability of Dan. There's another one with you, too. What's that one? Sad journal comic squad?

Unknown 6:30
Oh, that's, that's another one.

Unknown 6:32
Okay, all right. All right. All the pollen storm. There's Jen. There's EUOO Todd Todd and john. That's a good one when it happens. Todd and Snell. Lyft. Just Kevin. Yeah, I can we still have any blank faces. I don't like the blank faces anyways. So I like that. Oh, and then we'll Chris. Of course, Mac started an entire slack for some reason that I'm Anyway, there's that. And then so I enjoy I enjoy these things. But oh, so the whole point of what I was trying to make, I'm sorry, it's early, is that I mean, I don't want to make this a thing about having a kid it's everybody has a kid in their innocence in that everybody has times when there's something they're just doing stuff with you. It could be cooking. It could be watching a TV show. It could be driving but everybody's got things where they're like, I can't stop what I'm doing right now. Really even to acknowledge this. You know what I mean? And if you get enough of those going on if I find these weird patterns as I've said before, I feel like I get at some point in the afternoon my time pacific time. There will be this bizarre confluence of notifications happening on my phone. We're like it's just one weird I guess just a lot of stuff happens in my life around like between like three and five, which I would partly peg to Central and East Coast people having an end to their day,

Unknown 8:10
or were bored near the end of the day. Yes.

Unknown 8:13
Well, it's windy. First of all, do you notice anything like this doesn't? Doesn't it feel like there are times where like it's all quiet for a while? And then do you get bursts of activity?

Unknown 8:22
Oh, I love the quiet times. Oh, absolutely. At the at the same time, as well as there's like a middle. It's like the dark texting group like where you know, everybody is talking at like 3am and you never know what's gonna go on they're not grow sexy stuff. Don't go there. But

Unknown 8:39
yeah, for me, that's my Twitter.

Unknown 8:41
Yeah, exactly. Pacific

Unknown 8:42
Pacific night. Twitter is a fun Twitter.

Unknown 8:45
It really is. That's it. People get a little silly. We

Unknown 8:48
have some drinks. And everybody that's that's the time that I've got to do things on Twitter. Have any like, focus. Now I don't really have I don't really have anything to say well, necktie Twitter is stroking it in the day hours. But like, but but at night That's awesome. That's when I got something to say. So you feel like so you do communicate a lot at night.

Unknown 9:10
That's the thing is I am either texting and communicating with people constantly all day long. Or not talking to anyone for days at a time because I'm not super great. And and just now our friend front of the show, Mr. soup, aka Kathy just texted me and she has a lot going on. She has a kid and sometimes I go very cute kid. Oh god she I had the pleasure of meeting her kid and I got her a great birthday card and now now we're on cool terms and very excited. Oh, that's awesome. Don't forget about my kid.

Unknown 9:43
Yes, I do. I don't Don't worry. Don't worry. I know I know that your kid is maybe not a thing you're gonna have soon but you already have some kids you need to need to maintain these relationships.

Unknown 9:53
I agree no

Unknown 9:55
pressure

Unknown 9:56
no pressure le got in early like that's it and also good.

So I can only have so many interests in each like microgeneration of child because the 12 year olds going to want something way different than eight year olds.

Unknown 10:21
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have any eight year olds in your life?

Unknown 10:24

I we went to Vegas in 2000, the summer of 2000. My lady friend and me. And we met my one of my best friends from back in Florida who my old housemate Dennis. It was awesome. Not the one whose cat pooped on my pillow. Um, this is this is Dennis who said if you see any bread, it's not here that bread is mine. It doesn't it doesn't exist for you. And we went to see the weirdest show. It was in the like downtown area, which as we know is code that's downtown is not quite as glitzy as like the four corners where all the good stuff happens. Mm hmm. And who did we see we went to see was it was a Marty Marty Feldman, Marty. One of those like 70s comics. And it was such a weird show. And he had like a hot wife, Marty Allen.

Unknown 16:46
I honestly I honestly cannot tell but it is

Unknown 16:50
there was one called like the Gold Coast or something like that. There was one where like, in you walk in there. And it's like it's like one of those YouTube videos of a place that used to be a mall. You just go in there. Just huge open ballrooms and nothing happening.

Unknown 17:04
I haven't left this building in 36 hours. Like I checked in but I have not gone out. I haven't seen this on. It's just a this whole convention is happening like in this casino. And it's

Unknown 17:17
it's I think I'm losing my mind. Do you do you do you do any gaming while you're there? Max?

Unknown 17:38
Yeah, I'm in magic live which is the biggest magic convention in eight I think in the world.

Unknown 17:44
Well, you must be you must really be in your corner. That's exciting for you you get to see you get to rub elbows with all those magic people.

Unknown 17:50
I'm having so much fun but also everyone got extremely sick after JM con. And so I'm also just I'm dying.

Unknown 17:57
Oh no I saw students do is sick. I saw

Unknown 18:01
almost I think there's something you know there's this thing that it's everyone calls it the Trinity q&a call it the con plague or the conference. Crowd Yeah. And like it's disgusting. And what it is, is that people I don't know, man, they don't wash their hands and everyone's touching each other and sharing food. And I'm sick. And did you get sick Alex? I didn't. But I took extreme measures this year. Like I don't think I had a

Unknown 18:26
you can't be more extreme than I am. It's impossible. Like rolling. I'm washing my hands and elbow bumping people. Max. Max, did you drink any open containers are like did you drink any sort of liquids out of glasses at any dinner? Wow.

Unknown 18:46
Don't you someone might have put their thumb on the glass.

Unknown 18:48
No, I think that everybody's gonna come in with the milk come in with the milk think because we're with people who are clearly exhausted and like this person is clearly getting sick. And so I just have you see how I kind of have that dishonored water bottle that looks like it is filled with P because it's got my little caffeine powders. I did not drink a single open thing.

Unknown 19:10
You are you're going for you went full Howard Hughes in the sense that we're making a little joke here it

Unknown 19:15
is very It is very upsetting at these things watching Alex walk around with your pistol

Unknown 19:22
it just gets bigger day by day as I get more and more tired and I asked

Unknown 19:27
you got a big

Unknown 19:29
carry to carry one that's clearly water and one that clearly looks like you're

Unknown 19:36
like yeah, when Nathan Nathan doesn't want to screw up which of the tubes is for poopy?

Unknown 19:42
Chile? Gotcha.

Unknown 19:49
Wow. Okay, so but you were Howard UZ in the sense that you're if somebody hands you

Unknown 19:54
I've got a new Howard Hughes. Mm hmm. I won't use the glasses. No tower.

Unknown 19:59
Oh, oh, that's so smart. So smart.

Unknown 20:02
I just have to say that if I was a housekeeper in a hotel room, and I had 100 I assume there's some sort of boss that's yelling at me. You know, Pastor, Pastor Go Go with to get all these rooms done. I bet they're under a lot of workplace pressure. And their job is very hard. And I think that if I was in their shoes, and I came into the room, and I would kind of squint at those glasses, and I'd go with those used and then I would go

Unknown 20:26
No, I'm leaving them. Before we even get to first principles. When you when you get to who has touched your toilet paper? Who has touched your glasses? Who has touched I got to talk about the coffee maker in a second. But ask yourself this who just touched all those things? The person who's been cleaning hotel rooms?

Unknown 20:43
Oh my god the coffee maker that can't be good to us

Unknown 20:46
ask yourself well ask yourself this. How often does that coffee maker number two? How does that cut off? And does that coffee maker get a real good clean and then number one imagine what happens to that coffee maker out of 100 visits you get all your news one person coming in the coffee machine that's all you need. And now that's that's just part of your your drink now. You know I mean it one German one board German like there's not a good chopped on and you just come in the coffee machine in the German style.

Unknown 21:16
A series send a text to Dr. Don

Unknown 21:21
Cafe is good. Oh

Unknown 21:25
you know well this is happening Dr. Don? MQ by Friday Yeah. And we need to know if it's safe to use the coffee machine in the hotel room. The answer is going to be now

Unknown 21:35
did you ask him if there's a way to know a German came in

Unknown 21:37
now I already know the answer. Dr. Don's gonna say it depends on your risk tolerance. It depends.

Unknown 21:42
Oh yeah, your attack vector.

Unknown 21:44
And please don't give us any quote it depends. Nonsense answer unquote.

Unknown 21:52
And like to what level of certainty Has he ever done a threat matrix on German coming? stuff coming?

Unknown 21:57
Merlin wants to know if you've ever done a threatening drinks on the coffee machine

Unknown 22:07
lever here's a new thing that I've decided to do in hotels. No turndown service No, you just keep Do Not Disturb on the entire time.

Unknown 22:21
Oh yes. Oh no, no, no, no housekeeping at all.

Unknown 22:24
No housekeeping it all because I love this

Unknown 22:27
how bad hotel is I think that one of the signature tells of how bad a hotel is now is how much they've tell how much they really push the like we're green angle and so so I take it for granted you

Unknown 22:40
just put up a big bamboo sign that says fuck you

Unknown 22:44
I take it for granted. So this one says this one I've got to SAVE OUR PLANET placard like by the sink saying like just your your your wet towels on the ground and then I've got one on the bed saying like they were it's like it says like throw this little sign on the floor if you want us to change your sheets we change we change the sheets monthly because we love them but but check this out when you check in they go we're committed to eco something and if you declined to have any room service will give you 10% off

Unknown 23:13
interesting weight on the whole oh

Unknown 23:17
that's just how much we love the earth.

Unknown 23:19
here's here's the problem i and this will come back to our challenge but I'm like all right I see these carts going around and the all these towels are just exposed to the open air all the time just

Unknown 23:31
just wet towels touching each other.

Unknown 23:33
Yeah, and I'm wondering if you have checked out of your room and it appears like there's been no like you haven't used the towels like dude you just put those back on the cart and then put them like those have been right above a toilet if the person before you has not put the toilet seat down and they have flushed it's just a direct funnel upward.

Unknown 23:52
It's a flu via Oh, it's just it's just a big poop capture.

Unknown 23:57
We stayed at a gross hotel. Did you see the the the picture that Professor Chapman posted of it's a it's a restroom and like a bathroom? And then it's just cow wall just kegs of beer being stored in the bathroom. And he's like I wonder what that sanitizing procedure is for these KO

Unknown 24:13
but I'll bet when it gets real busy you still spend 2025 minutes doing a tank wipe? Yeah Yeah, well you really got me thinking about it max I think was you that got me thinking about the if you don't close the lid. it sprays everywhere. It gets splatter that you can't see everywhere. I think I do. I do really? I do think about that. Now.

Unknown 24:36
How do you not?

Unknown 24:37
Let's see I had another I had I talked about this last week on the podcast were at the where were we staying at the Hilton in Indianapolis? Alex?

Unknown 24:44
Yep, the Hilton Indianapolis garden in LA.

Unknown 24:48
No, no, we weren't at the Garden Inn. That's a different hotel now. I don't it's the one with the circle. That's I don't know the one where you pull in. In in sweets. There's four Hilton's in Indianapolis but we were staying at the vanilla Hilton not the garden and not the Conrad just the Hilton. And I had an issue where I tried to talk about this on the show where I checked in like two in the morning Oh yeah, yeah with your lobby card right and then would not give me a card they said we're not authorized to give you a card and so a lady had like unpack like kings and bring all my shit up and unpack it and like it was it was just I just didn't like it I just didn't it was not a service that I wanted I just wanted to bring my own shit up to my room. But you know when you go to junk family drive into my car is like five do the laziest packing right I have all this like shit in my car and

Unknown 25:37
inefficient stuff. Yeah,

Unknown 25:40
yeah, I do need the cart. And then when it's when I went to check out I don't know why I was just like, I had like a rough day. And I and I was tired and I just needed the card and so I went down to the bellhop or whatever. And I was like, man, please have a card to pack my own room on and I and they were like, please have a card. Please never please have the cart and they said, No, we have to send someone up to pack your stuff up.

Unknown 26:04
So it was just to be clear now that means it was not one angry rogue agent know his policy.

Unknown 26:09
I watched this all weekend was critical.

Unknown 26:11
Maybe it was like the 2am guy shift, you know that whatever, right?

Unknown 26:16
And maybe somebody for whatever reason got a vibe about you. You seem like a car thief to them or so you're going to come on it or something. And they maybe they could tell you people get kind of vibe, but you got it again.

Unknown 26:28
Yeah, so I go, this was in the middle of the day. And I go down, they had the carts that weren't out, I could see them right there. And I said, Man, please borrow cart. And I promise I will bring it back in five minutes. I just needed to bring all my my bags and stuff down. Because I have all these like grocery bags with like board games and prototypes and shooting in it. And and they were like, they were like, well, we could send someone to pack all your stuff up. And I was like, No, no, thank you. I just want the card. I don't need that. And they go, well, we're not allowed to do that or supervisor would fire us if we let you have the card. And I said well does anyone at the hotel have a card that Kumbaro and they said no weird that they we do that service? And I was like well, this is ridiculous. I was like I've never stayed in a hotel or they wouldn't give you a cart and they were like well, we're a full service. The guy says to me Well, we're a full service

Unknown 27:16
What do you what's the what's the thing valet? We're a full service like valet service because it's like also the guys who park your car right? Oh, I remember the first time we went somewhere I mean, I think this is weirdly related the very first time when my wife and I stayed somewhere where there because I grew up in Florida where like this is a giant parking lot for everything. And remember the very first time we stayed at a hotel where you had to valet park your car and you had to pay $30 a night full stop if you've got a car

Unknown 27:43
Same deal similar Do you think it's a similar deal here?

Unknown 27:45
I'm there was no other parking available at this hotel. I parked actually parked in the parking garage for two nights because I couldn't stand the use the valet.

Unknown 27:54
Wow. Okay,

Unknown 27:55
but but yes, it's the same deal. Like there's no there's no like parking lot at the hotel like you just if you're parking at the hotel, their valet in your car. That's the deal.

Unknown 28:02
But I guess I just mean in that sense, like a it's a revenue stream. But it's also a way for them to conclusively say we don't even have like apples saying like, we don't have a way to get to your data and their case, they'd be like, well, you have to do valet parking. And I wonder if it's similar thing here where, but like they're not gonna that's not a revenue stream for them. You might get a tip. But like why would you be so aggravated? Why would you be so hostile like that

Unknown 28:25
I give the girl $5 for the first time you brought my shit up, I forgave her five bucks, and I but I was under protest. I said, I really don't want the service. I said, Please just let me remind things up. And then I felt like I had to tip. What am I going to not tell her so it's not her. So I gave her five bucks. So anyway, I'm the one and then I couldn't let it go. So I went to the front desk, and I said, I'd like a cart. And they were like, We don't have any carts. And I was like, what kind of a hotel doesn't have a luggage cart? Like, that's like a core competency of the hotel of letting me bring my bags up and down. And they were like, well, it's only the valet and then at this point, I'm getting into it with the guy. And so the valet comes down. And he's like, and he's like I could be here happened to Central wanted to pack your stuff up. And I'm like, but I wouldn't be happy to have that happen. And he goes, Well, it's our policy, that anytime that you have a valet card has to be attended by one of our staff, people who handles the bags. And I said, well, it's my policy that I never have a staff person with me that I always handle my bags myself. So now our policies are in conflict. And we have to we have to resolve this somehow. And the guy goes, Well, we're a full service valet so I can't let you do that. And I said, Well, right now, I said right now it's a no service la because there's only one thing I want, which is the car, you won't give it to me. And he goes, well, that wouldn't be service. And I said it would be service to me because that's what I want. And then in the end, I didn't get the cart. Okay,

Unknown 29:38
you should demand a trial by combat.

Unknown 29:44
I choose the mountain

Unknown 29:48
will be my champion.

Unknown 29:59
I don't know, I couldn't let it go. I never get into those like customer service altercations. Like I'm like the opposite of a let me talk to your manager guy. And I just couldn't for whatever reason I just I just, I couldn't let it go

Unknown 30:10
either through this thing where you're like, I went through this recently with ups in a way that was became extremely comical. And I even as I was on the phone, and I was having a conversation with a person who was saying English words, and I still couldn't understand what anyone was. I was very confused. And she just kept saying, this has been updated. It is at the warehouse. I said I understand. You've had it out for delivery for four days now. And then it goes back to the warehouse and she says that's correct. And I say okay, so when I'm so I realize I sound I sound like a character and a Kafka novel. When will the thing arrive at my house? And she says, well, the latest update is that it's it's currently at the warehouse. And so I understand that. I said, I said The thing is, it had been out for delivery three days. And then on Saturday, I called you That was the third time I called you. And I said yes, I said it's a my here and they said it was at the warehouse and they said they let called they left me a message and said it'll definitely delivered on Monday, it'll be on and then on Monday at went out. And then one o'clock, I got a delay exception. And it said it going back to the warehouse, which says that's correct. It's currently at the warehouse. I said, I said, I'm really explaining this so poorly. I feel really bad to keep bringing this up. This is a very costly chair. For me, it was a lot of money. Wendy, do you have a new chair like a new chair? When will the chair When will the chair arrive? And she said, Well, the latest update that I have from from your local warehouses that it is at the warehouse right now. And I said, Thank you do you have? what I'm wondering is Do you know when the chair will be delivered? Because it's been out for delivery for four days? And she said, and she said, I've just checked and if you just give me a minute, I will contact a local warehouse. And she so I was on hold. And then she came back. She said latest update is it's currently at the warehouse. And I said, I said thank you for that update. Do you have any sense of when given that as every four days it has a delay exception every afternoon? Do you have a sense of what the problem might be? is it's something wrong? Is the chair broken? Has it been recognized as ammunition and customs? Is there anything that you could tell me about when it would actually be delivered? Because the thing is the reason I bought it was to have it Amazon Amazon went ahead and use y'all for the delivery part. So it's been out for deliver off the delivery for days. Do you have a sense of said currently the latest update is that it's at the warehouse, and I said okay, I ordered it last week from Amazon and then they use ups Do you have a sense of when it will be delivered? And that they don't hold again? And she came back and said it's currently at the warehouse? Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Unknown 32:39
Thank you I'm very I'm very satisfied with my care.

And the guy goes, we put you on hold for one final time you wait on hold for 40 minutes and then it just hangs up on you. Oh,

Unknown 33:18

Unknown 33:30
beginning you gotta fight to let this the six fingered man is you have to start you basically start over and you'll have they go to a prima DOS and then yeah, and you go back to the whole thing again. What's your tracking number? And so from the other room my daughter heard me I had a whole draft document to keep track of all that was happening when she heard me from the other room.

Unknown 34:36
Oh, wow. I had no empathy until the robot. I'm

Unknown 34:48
really falling I would lose my goddamn mind. Because I didn't reach a point where I had been through this for five business days. And the same thing happened every day. And no one would admit it was weird.

Unknown 34:59
That's Did you get the chair?

Unknown 35:01
Yes. I'm sitting in it now.

Unknown 35:03
Oh, nice.

Unknown 35:05
Little chair pic. No,

Unknown 35:08
it was costly. No one discuss it. I'll send you a photo but you know how to talk about it.

Unknown 35:13
So Dr. Dr. Don wrote me back he says I have not done a threat matrix on the hotel coffee machines. And he goes I have used hotel coffee makers before if that helps you gauge risk. And he said it's pretty low risk the water is boiled in the coffee is not

Unknown 35:29
about drinking the coffee. You asked about using the coffee maker that way two different things

Unknown 35:34
we like what a few but what if you boil the water in a toilet? I mean, it's toilet.

Unknown 35:41
poop in there, but it's boiled. It's fine. Good, good. Good. Good Professor Chapman on this.

Unknown 35:46
That's a handsome chair. You know that kind

Unknown 35:48
of looks like the captain's chair from voyage it sort of does the arms move a lot and without much touching and Syracuse recommends taking the arms off of our chair. It's extremely adjustable. And yeah, it doesn't look like you

Unknown 36:02
gotta you gotta get Alex in there every week.

Unknown 36:10
Today, two wheels one on

Unknown 36:13
two wheels.

Unknown 36:22
This is what Alex would do. Like a Bond villain. She'd be like Mr. Bond, but see how you deal with.

Unknown 36:32
He'd be like, he'd be like, Can you go back to beating my testicles? Please?

Unknown 36:37
Beating again? Oh, no, he's like a wheel off my rope beating chair. Gets a chair

Unknown 36:42
like that. That's so weird. You gotta like extreme restraints. You're like I would like something that's kind of like a toilet where I could make government agents sit on it and then I hit his balls with a big naughty rope. rope. he's a he's a bad boy.

Unknown 36:57
You know, it's not really discussed in the James Bond camera, but he's 100% infertile

Unknown 37:21
I've often thought about if I were to torture the male anatomy I don't really know how I'm like I don't I really have no desire to ever kill a human being but I bet there's a situation in which I'm going to have to torture someone's balls. And I don't know how could could I kill somebody for like

Unknown 37:41
for like as a Patreon rule? Yeah,

Unknown 37:43
like Okay, so we've got that hundred thousand dollar Patreon reward if the iPhone cut them off does do you bleed out? Like do you poke it with a stick? I truly

Unknown 37:51
fantasy cut or like real cut?

Unknown 37:54
Like No, no, no, like full on. I just saw mid summer so I'm a little bit late but that's a minute

Unknown 37:58
to medical procedure. Alex I don't know if you could fake cut it you could make them give you money you could do financial ball smacking. That's huge right now.

Unknown 38:06
I so I've heard so I've heard I'd be the worst Dominator

Unknown 38:10
you should have. You should be like the lady who hacks into your computer you should do that.

Unknown 38:13
I could do that. I can get into your Wi Fi like oh,

Unknown 38:18
well not with euro I think you're already torturing them Alex just by not being interested in them sexually. I think that's all the torture any man needs.

Unknown 38:25
Yeah, I want a manifesto written about me.

Unknown 38:30
Manifesto. Sweetie.

Unknown 38:41
I feel like there hasn't been a lot of Arabian Prince activity lately, and it makes me a little bit worried that they've killed all the Falcons because what else are you going to talk about on Reddit with Arabian princes like

Unknown 38:53
there's a rumor There's a rumor that MBS is dating Lindsay Lohan. What? Why wrong? Did I dream that? I don't know man vs. Lindsay Lohan. She's got a lot of balls in the air. What's going on between Lindsay Lohan? Oh, no. Lindsay Lohan. Oh, my gosh. She's very dewy. Oh, oh, yeah. So moist.

Unknown 39:15
She, man she's kind of I feel about her the same way. I feel about Amanda Bynes. were like, I just wanted to be your best friend as a kid. Like when you want to be best friends with somebody in high school and then you realize oh, really dodged a bullet there. Oh, no. Lindsay Lohan. I

Unknown 39:32
just want I just want her to be happy.

Unknown 39:34
Mm hmm. You can she likes Falcons.

Unknown 39:37
In what sense? Like in a sexual way, like in a way?

Unknown 39:40
No, just as a sporting hobby. Oh,

Unknown 39:42
I bet she fucking love so who wouldn't love?

Unknown 39:44
Like Falcons? Yes, yeah,

Unknown 39:47
no, no, no. Who wouldn't like a hog? What were you saying about?

Unknown 39:52
That doesn't matter. I I feel like I feel like one way to quickly gauge how much you can trust. There are many ways to gauge how much you can trust your hotel room. I think one What if you only can check one thing, look behind the TV sub.

Unknown 40:05
Let's look right now. I'm going to borrow.

Unknown 40:10
I can almost promise you it's going to be a lot more dusty than you would like. But they're also maybe it's

Unknown 40:15
quite quite clean back there.

Unknown 40:17
Okay, well, then you're that's okay. That's just the first pass. I'm saying if you walk into a hotel room, oh, no, wait, not. If that's real, real bad. You know, that place has not gotten a good cleaning at all. It's quite dusty back there.

Unknown 40:31
I actually feel good about this. Because I often do, like I you know, I often break the rules and pull everything out to get to the HDMI something or other and usually it's pretty clean, cleaner than my TV. All right. All right, what's step two?

Unknown 40:47
Oh, I mean, there's a whole bunch. We should I mean, I think I've covered this on back to work. But I haven't I had

Unknown 40:52
never heard that. I have never heard the TV one that is very good. Well,

Unknown 40:55
I have a whole protocol I go through. I mean, like, for example, Max mentioned, seeing the green placard in the bathroom. Well, that's a rookie mistake. Because the first thing you do when you walk in there, and you look at the pilot TV, say should I even be here? I pick up every piece of marketing material and put it in a drawer. Anything that has printing on it from the company has to go in a drawer say that's one fake plants go in the closet,

Unknown 41:20
and you touch the fake plants. Why?

Unknown 41:24
Well, I mean, you know what, you're right.

Unknown 41:26
Is this an aesthetic thing? Because I totally understand that.

Unknown 41:29
It's a sad, it's a sad, sad thing. And you can make my own you know, saying, All right, take all those take all those pillows off the bed, throw them away, throw the pillows away. Take the bedspread off the bed. Absolutely. Absolutely. That's that is covered with come.

Unknown 41:42
For me. There's something about being in a hotel room, where I'm constantly. I'm never okay. We start here whenever you're living out of a hotel room or whatever you never like on time for anything, like every single little thing in your life as a last minute panel, right? Like when you Alex, you agree with this, like when we're at these conventions, and you're in a hotel for a week. Like you're never like, Oh, look at me I lose

Unknown 42:02
track of time in general done. Yeah.

Unknown 42:04
Well, it's just it's just it's like you're working these long hours. And you have like, you have like, you know, like literally like 19 hour days. You're not sleeping like your your your whole you know, routine, like everything is chaos. And then it's like suddenly, like when people are texting you and they're like, let's get breakfast in five minutes. You're

Unknown 42:22
running around. You're like, Where's my where's my

Unknown 42:24
everything? Travis McIlroy is here. Where's Max? Yeah.

Unknown 42:32
You need some water to be on time. I'm telling you.

Unknown 42:35
It's crazy. It's uh, it's really crazy situation. And so then you add to that, that you don't know where anything is, like, all your stuff is just scattered. Now I have my little I have my little red ox valet. Right. I'm sharing. I'm looking at it right now. And it's got my wallet, my hotel key

Unknown 42:50
little little snap and little snappy basket. The snappy basket snapping the champion mascara First thing first thing I take out it's always on top of my suitcase. First thing you do take out the road. Affiliate deal with them. Yeah. I love that. I love that thing. That I guess that is a very important piece because that's where you put the you put your you put your wallet. You put the keys,

Unknown 43:09
Merlin, I gotta give it up to you. You said this and we all made fun of you on the in the Alps episode. And I got when I and then I thought about it and I thought about it. And I said, you know I never know where my keys and wallet are in the hotel room. And so I bought the Liotard

Unknown 43:23
is there, the red the Red Sox, not the best stick is home. That's home that you start that at home when that goes down. That's where the important things go because the hotel room will eat everything. Unless you keep it I don't even take things out of my packing cubes. I put them in put the packing cubes into a drawer maybe who knows who's coming that Oh

Unknown 43:40
no, you put things into drawers you are I apologize

Unknown 43:45
if I'm there for a while if I'm there for a while Sure.

Unknown 43:47
I will open the doors to deposit any of the sort of hotels papers unplug any sort of all you know what they fucking love now are these like, I home phone docs that you Whoa, they're just they're just they just have a million lights and LEDs on them with a 30 with a 30 pin the 30 pin.

Unknown 44:06
JACK

Unknown 44:07
Yeah. So that immediately gets unplugged and it goes into the drawer. It all goes into the drawer.

Unknown 44:11
you unplug all your phones. you unplug the you unplug the phones. Oh, it's a

Unknown 44:16
plug to put in the drawers. I put the phones in a drawer too. Yeah, I'm

Unknown 44:18
afraid that I'll set on fire and not escape. That's that's my one thing. Unplug.

Unknown 44:23
And then and then here's the key thing. They here's a technology that you should consider adopting Merlin, then the doors are never opened again. The Doors must always remain sealed. Because then when you go to pack, you've now eliminated that one thing of like, Is there something and

Unknown 44:39
also, I mean, like, psychologically, you have removed all of the hotel illness that you can. So if you do leave, everybody leaves a charger behind sometimes something like that. But now you know, I mean also, you know I use an anchor hub where everything is in one area. I'm not one of those idiots who fucking cool just plugging my phone in this wall over here, dude, behind the chair. Like No, don't do that. You want to minimize the amount of spread that you can do. I just don't like living out of a literal suitcase for more than a day or two personally. But I like this I like this technology. Yeah, I feel like you got to make it your own. But you know, there's just so much common there. I mean, just so much historical com

Unknown 45:16
I've also got my my magic stuff I've been struggling over the last year with like, how do I travel with my net? How much magic stuff is the right of the magic stuff to bring and how do I travel with it. And I put a lot of work into like over the years like I have like a podcaster egg that I'm talking to you on right now. And it's quite small like I bought enough like Marco products that it all fits into it all collapses into nothing into it can share pack monkey with my socks in my suitcase. And I've really had to do a lot of work on the magic problem to figure out what the right amount of magic is. And I got it down so small for this trip. It's I'm so excited.

Unknown 45:52
It's a very nice feeling. That's a really nice

Unknown 45:54
One One little one little zippered pouch like it's like a like a half of a toiletries pouch very small.

Unknown 46:02
Think about how max gets his magic tricks into things and wondering like why can't be there aren't we've talked about this. There aren't a lot of magic pants made for women. But why don't they make like a tampon pants for women. So you just have little holsters that are hidden like at your ankles

Unknown 46:19
and like a band like a Bandelier.

Unknown 46:22
Yeah, like you You just there's so many. There's so much bullshit we need all the time and I

Unknown 46:28
love snatch Mr. tampon.

Unknown 46:32
There was this commercial in but late.

Unknown 46:35
He's putting out the cigarette in the golf tee.

Unknown 46:39
He's got the tampon is wearing his magic pants.

Unknown 46:42
Do you remember that commercial where this is when there was like the new tampon technology of basically it was small. Like that was the only thing

Unknown 46:52
EOB like when the EOB first came out?

Unknown 46:54
The I don't see I don't know. No, I think it was after that. But it there's this commercial. It is a high school class one girls passing a colorful thing to another, like in a clutch. Yeah, yeah. And the the teacher goes, come up here, bring that with you. And the girl brings her lovely little tampon to the front. And he goes, Well, did you bring enough for the whole class? And she's like, just the girls. And that's the whole commercial. And I realized it worked really well. Because for that weird thing. I you're making a me noise. What's wrong is because I'm talking about tampons. I'm sorry.

Unknown 47:33
Do you know the guys from you know the so we complain about they don't make the community jeans anymore? Right, the Levi's community and nice. And then these? Yeah, the one the good ones. I mean, they still make them by name, but it's a different product and they suck it and so we got an email from our friends at Dearborn denim and they said we make like high end awesome. Blue Jeans in Chicago. So they invited us to go visit the factory and check out the jeans and you already anxiously emailed them back and you said if we do it, but I wear a pair of Levi's YBM know and I got six I went on our website to see what their deal was. And then I got so excited about their their like offering that I went that like i'd stopped everything I was doing that day and I went to the Dearborn denim store and I got two pairs of pants. And they're there and they're amazing. So here's here's number one. Here's the first thing they do, right? It's called Dearborn denim. So here's the first thing they do, right? They have you ever Okay, you know Levi's they they I what I like about Levi's is they don't look like anything it's like very it's like Westworld when they see something not from the world that doesn't look like anything to me like I really would prefer to not be noticed for the type of pants and I'm wearing right and so to me if you get any brand other than Levi's they generally have some sort of crazy they've got fucking flames on them or they're distressed or they have like racing stripes like there's something on them where you're like

Unknown 48:56
tg to your point they they're trying to look like more than Levi's on purpose

Unknown 49:03
correct and and you know there's something there's something about it where you look at them and you go these are weird man like you're trying to get noticed for your pants and

Unknown 49:13
a nice pad

Unknown 49:16
those prescription pads

Unknown 49:19
powerless and more power to you if you're like if you're like flames flame decal on your pants guy and that's cool, but definitely but what's cool about Dearborn denim is they make very very super high as far as I can tell super high quality denim that feels amazing and it it's not the same as Levi's but it's it

Unknown 49:39
is nice.

Unknown 49:41
Yeah, they

Unknown 49:43
love darts I love darts are so thoughtful that's a nice nice way to finish something those

Unknown 49:47
are somewhat goofy commuter ones which I didn't do I just did the normal skinny jeans. Okay, well I'm on the wrong page then. Okay. Yeah, just just look at the normal the normal computer the normal skinny jeans, but here's the thing. So here's the deal when you go to the Dearborn denim store them they do not sell pants by life they sell them by waist size so you select the pair you want by waist size and then they measure you and they hand them in the store while you wait to your vacation and I you have no idea what a fucking game changer This is for me oh I absolutely do oh my god like if you're not I mean I have a we I'm a weird I'm in a regular height so I always need to get my pants and but if there's people out there

Unknown 50:30
all of my body I have this and probably you know like models look like every part of them as long when you look at a modeling like they have long legs and a long torso. How is that possible? I have short of short everything. My penis is amazing but my rise is very and so it's been so everything I feel like I look like I'm trying to make some kind of like old man joke with all my pants in there too long and then it's just it's just

Unknown 50:52
all their genes are just are just huge tubes of fabric that go down forever. And then they and then they and then they measure you in the store and they go Eminem right there. And I was like this is the greatest. They have two stores in Chicago. The store was super nice. The guy was super helpful EM the jeans for me and it's all I've worn since I'm fully converted over onto your born denim. I give them my strongest endorsement

Unknown 51:13
you're selling you're selling past the clothes I need to have these right now. Okay, so I see tailored relaxed slim, why

Unknown 51:19
don't you come to know that's not

Unknown 51:23
tailored. Okay. Well, what's the distinction between tailored and slim slim is tighter tailored is normal, relaxed is jokey Kinko's. Yeah, okay, so tailored is normal. Is that right? tailored is normal? I believe that's right. Yeah. What am I looking at here? 10 ounce. 13 year olds looking at 13 ounce dark wash.

Unknown 51:40
Now I did black I did all black jeans decided because I kind of want to go into that Kevin but Nick look like Kevin always looks cool in those dark jeans.

Unknown 51:49
He's got the stems for it. Yeah.

Unknown 51:54
I'm gonna start out with a start up my do 35th they're not gonna

Unknown 51:57
hand them they're not gonna hand them for you because you not used to come into the store. You're missing the little I

Unknown 52:02
can tell they're going to do something like handing because guess what, they've got different sizes of length than are just even numbers. Here's the thing though. I'm going to get 3531 Look at me. I'm a hideous freak everything about his God number 3531. That's not a pair of pants I've ever seen in my life. They don't make them because apparently I'm a hideous freak. Test greed is not deserve odd numbers by the neck until dead.

Unknown 52:30
I think we need to go to the tour to hang out that you weren't done and people in toward the factory. And then I think we need to start to get them to make custom special pants for us. big win jackets. I already want to I already want special magic pants. I need some special features in my pants for manager. And I think that you should get your tampon band.

Unknown 52:53
And you should in the ankle. Just one little one little How hard could that be? It's one little piece of fabric and they sell it in. Mm hmm. I can and they support Apple Pay so I just bought pants.

Unknown 53:05
Oh, well that that doesn't get you to Chicago nothing. Well.

Unknown 53:12
Do you ever think about what I'd like to have this thought experiment every few months of I wonder what would get Merlin to Chicago but it ends pretty quickly.

Unknown 56:22
Oh, do so. Well. Do we want to talk about

Unknown 56:27
Trump's method of liking tweets, please.

Unknown 56:30
All right. Maybe series.

Unknown 56:32
I'm gonna do a Temkin intelligence, intelligence sir. Trump's method method of liking tweets is needlessly complicated. The irony of Donald Trump's Twitter dominance is that apart from his apparent mastery of micro blogging, of the micro blogging platform, he's largely a Luddite. He doesn't use a computer. He's likely never downloaded an app and as political political reported Monday, he does all all of his news reading with the exception exception of Fox News runs on paper. He even has his staff print out the Drudge Report for him.

Unknown 57:09
That looks great on a resume. Yep, printed out. Report.

Unknown 57:13
Drudge Report, by the way, has no articles like all these links.

Unknown 57:17
It's just a headline. But the most high popping revelation from political Politico's dive into Trump's reading habit is that is decidedly analog method for liking it. I can't read first a quick reminder. Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba. Alright, the president take this was even been known. I got it. I got it. I wasn't prepared. And now I got it. Hmm. The President has even been known to send printouts of tweets he likes after he liked one gets tweets. He had it printed by a staffer signed it and requested that no Oxford comma again. Wow. And requested that it be sent to is a gas is a gates gates congressional office where the now frame tweet hangs. So from the original Politico article, does he do this with every like, tweet, does he just like go through Twitter and like them? And then he has people print stuff out?

Unknown 58:10
I don't think so. I think he's using I think he's using the Twitter app, or him or or Pascal? Or maybe who knows, just give me know. There's another one that does a lot of his stuff. I've heard many different reports about how he does this. I've heard that he dictates but like there's just certain things. I don't know. I think he I think he probably uses the Twitter app, don't you? There's no way I don't know. I just I don't know, I've just always assumed that. I but on the other hand, he also very much strikes me as somebody who does not read replies. I think when he retweets and likes and all that stuff, that stuff is really really awful stuff. I get the feeling that could be him, but I get the feeling of probably skip, you know, skip, you know, finding something he knows the Trump would be into. So whenever people say Donald Trump tweets this Donald Trump retweets that I was like, Oh, well, I mean, that's kind of like saying ups tweeted that well know somebody who works at UPS tweeted that. It's, you know what I mean, he I think, I think there's a team of people who are probably involved. I don't I mean, I have let me ask you this. Have you ever seen any photos of him holding information from

Unknown 59:21
the No,

Unknown 59:22
no, no. I mean, given how much he appears to be engaged with Twitter, doesn't it seem like I mean, have you ever seen like a lump in his pocket from a phone? Like, it's just weird? It's It is strange that like, given how much, but I guess it again, on the other hand, there's not that many photos of him watching TV, so I don't know.

Unknown 59:39
I think he always has a phone on him. Even if that phone isn't charged. It's like he wants that power of he's got the phone.

Unknown 59:47
No, I think he's from a different. He's from another generation where it's more powerful to have someone else hand you the phone when you want to.

Unknown 59:53
It doesn't like being handed things.

Unknown 59:55
Yeah. But he had the little pissy fit where he wanted to keep his phone. And when they tried to give him like a lockdown iPhone or something.

Unknown 1:00:01
He had that incredibly compromised Android phone.

Unknown 1:00:04
It's not like in his own pocket, though. It's that he didn't. So the issue is that he probably has some staff person or aide who carries it with him. He's got a Gary and the Gary ends of a phone and he doesn't want to phone he doesn't know how to use He only knows how to use the Android. It's all about that. He doesn't want to do any work or learn a new phone.

Unknown 1:00:21
Yeah, but now No, but I mean, the activity on the phone is now on Twitter. It's all it's always iPhone. Now. It says Todd and other people pointed out It used to be you could tell the ones that were from him versus his staff. That was a fun time. When it was from an Android phone. You knew it was him. And if it was from an iPhone, you know, it was one of his staff. And Todd Todd and some other people did some really good research on that.

Unknown 1:00:41
I still think even if he isn't even if it isn't on him, his Gary always has a phone that's like, quote his you know what I mean?

Unknown 1:00:50
So into phones, he look at that, look at how often there's a phone in the picture. And in this photograph, he loves phones. He loves being photographed, like talking on the phone, his fucking car. I think he loves phones. And I think he loves signing things, which was what inspired me to do a fast whistle stop tour. So in this case, he loves assigning a piece of paper that has a tweet on it. And then he gives that to somebody so they can frame it. Somebody horrible from Florida like Mac AIDS. So I just want to do it. Yeah, you can click these links if you want. I know many of these are already well known. I just want to do a quick whistle stop tour of some of the things that Donald Trump has autographed. Mm hmm. All right, go go for it just real quick. There's so many visited, visited people after a storm and Alabama, Alabama and he signed Bibles their photos of the Bible's that he assigned, he signed a wall at a storm shelter where they're bad tropical storm and people had been evacuated. He signed their Snopes check, he did sign a lady's chest. There's a photograph of that he signed a $20 bill that's available on eBay. He signed a copy of Playboy that he was on the cover of and my favorite, as pictured in our show notes is when he sent a print out of a map. Bibi Netanyahu, he signed it and then pointed to the Golan Heights with a sharpie arrow and said nice.

Unknown 1:02:07
Oh my god,

Unknown 1:02:10
but he thought he signed a map of Israel because, you know, night What, what what do we mean when we say on the nose?

Unknown 1:02:17
Nice. Nice heights.

Unknown 1:02:20
Wow,

Unknown 1:02:22
that that wasn't very good. But I just I'm very intrigued by how much he loves. And then of course is the became a whole mean, we're like he loves signing something. And you have to admit he has a very cool autograph. But he, he loves holding up the thing. Like, like he like he just made up. He's like, check it out. Totally. So

Unknown 1:02:44
he's, he, he's you have to understand that Trump is kind of a cosplayer. Like, he's, he's this kind of he's kind of

Unknown 1:02:51
he's kind of the poor. The poor man's idea of a rich man. Was that any lead with um, what was the lady like in New York? Alex, what's her

Unknown 1:02:59
name? Amen. Now, yeah, it was a Jewish woman. New York

Unknown 1:03:03
likes this. Fix this so that I sound smart.

Unknown 1:03:07
The the writer, the donkey writer in New York that we love.

Unknown 1:03:11
What's her name? Fuck. That's literally half of the lesbians in New York. What are you talking? Allison Bechtel is

Unknown 1:03:17
321 somebody once said that Trump is the poor man's idea of a rich man.

Unknown 1:03:23
Oh, yes, Ellison

Unknown 1:03:31
friendly. Fran. Who's the writer in New York. Okay, Alex you know all these people are just York. Aren't you want to slack with all these people? These uh,

Unknown 1:03:43
I literally ran Liebowitz

Unknown 1:03:45
friend Francis and Liebowitz.

Unknown 1:03:47
Ok, ok. Ok. I genuinely on my left corner.

Unknown 1:03:50
Anyway. 321 they said it says they said it's in the warehouse. They said it's in the warehouse. That was the latest update. And I said thank you for that update to the information is it so the reason that I bought it from Amazon and they sent it through the ups service is that when I bought the chair, which is very costly for me, it's a lot of money for me. I don't wanna I don't want to sound like I'm Dunning you about this, but I do. There's a lot invested in this chair. I said, Do you have any sense of when it will be delivered as the chair that I purchased from Amazon and sat through ups? And she said, according to list updated still at the warehouse. So friendly Woods really took off cosplay

Unknown 1:04:24
cosplay? No, that's okay. He's just he's a he's a. He's a dot. He's He's not a very smart man. He's a pretty dumb guy. And he just sort of he just sort of in the 80s, he realized that he was going to basically be an actor playing the part of an atheist business guy. You know, I don't think that he makes any deals like I don't think he's involved in any of this stuff. I think that he's basically licenses his name. And then he has this incredible instinct for like attention. And he really like I like, it's not even he realized it's like the grifters around him realize that he that Trump can go around, sort of get a key commands attention. Like there's just something about the guy, he's got that that sociopath instinct of like, he can make the whole room just like look at him and talk about him and make everything about him. And he was good at manipulating, like the tabloid press, and then the real press and now the whole country. And he's not doing it for any reason. Other than that, that's just like instinctively what he wants to do. But he's like, cosplaying This, this, these increasingly important roles in society. And so the Republican Party, I

Unknown 1:05:27
mean, would be like saying a bear is good at sleeping or lions good at eating. It's like, it is just his instinct, as you said, he realized that he's a, he's a man who came from money, who was then able to play the role of someone who had money. Let's not even talk about the fact that if he just stuck it on an index fund, he'd have 10 times more money today. This is an idiot. But then but you really nail it though, because you get to the time of the apprentice, where like, now he is he is cosplaying himself as a more successful version of himself, which then did actually bring him money such that he could license his name.

Unknown 1:06:00
I think Trump was I think he's always been a little bit ahead of his time, even now in the way that he understands, like optics. He understands how to give those pictures, people and to make, you know, it's a cosplayers know, they're like, Well, I'm not going to exactly become this video game character, but it's like, but but people who are really good at cosplay, and they're really good at making those costumes, they're like, Okay, if I were to break down this character, the things that make you recognize them are like the shoulder pads, the weapons and the makeup, and if I can nail those three things, like you'll buy it, right, and Trump gets it. He's like, in order to cosplay as the President, I need to hold up a lot of binders and I need to sit at a desk with a phone on it like he he sort of he's, he's really good if he gets those three, but he's also very, he's also very committed to it whereas somebody like Delaney just looks like an idiotic thumb. Up there cosplaying some kind of gravitas public official, do they so not understand? But also, like, Listen, Trump realized that but then there's like, the whole metal layer to it right of like, Trump realize or Trump didn't realize any of this but like, what the Republican Party wanted was someone they needed someone who could be both at the simultaneously both at the same time someone who could sort of play the part of the president but also that they knew was just playing the part but in their heart was actually it's like racist xenophobe who would do awful things in order to get them high paying manufacturing jobs, you know, included you know, commit war crimes, lock people up indefinitely in internment camps, like you know, I mean, like those are the basically the people want it, what they what they want, what they really want, but they can't say as someone who will who will violate human rights and turn America into a fascist state so that they can have a high paying manufacturing job.

Unknown 1:07:38
That's a lot. I mean, the this is your whole hillbilly elegy bullshit, which is that like, and you do really feel for people who are featured in those New York Times, profiles that sucks. Like, it's, you know, it's like you say you always root for what he say the root for the wall, not the egg, or the egg, not the wall. Right, right. You always pulling for the underdog. And like you certainly feel for these folks. But like it is it's weird how it is ironic, in the extent to which the drive for on the one hand, these men who used to have what they regarded as it were going to look back on this period of like, Oh, you could just go go to Detroit and get a job making $15 an hour and send your kids to college, we're going to look back at that as a glancingly short period of time. Or you can work in a coal you could

Unknown 1:08:19
have you could have a job in college and pay for your tuition.

Unknown 1:08:23
Right, right, right. No, because the thing is, though, everybody's trying to get back to this time that never existed, because they're trying to cherry pick all these anyway, the point being, you got the men who now feel incredibly don't want to say it, but the part that kills them is how disempowered they are. And they're women, the women and they're like hate seeing them that way. So of course they're all going to pull for this guy who seems to be exacting seems to be exactly vengeance on what they perceive as the cause of their problems. But

Unknown 1:08:48
Trump is Trump is it's so it's like, it's such a, it's such a it's such a complicated thing to explain. But Trump is like, on the one hand, he's not even good at the cosplay, right? Like he's so bad at projecting this image of a you're competent adult. But that's also what people like about him is that the sloppiness of that he's just barely pretending to be the sort of guy in charge of the system, but that we you know, we all know what he's really about, you know, and you can interpret

Unknown 1:09:14
so many things from him as a wink, whether you're a white nationalist, or whether you are a QN on person, you can so what you can interpret so many things, there's I am so into fucking bananas QN on lately, like all the codes and the counting, and the numbers, and it's all so crazy right now. But like, he leaves enough open to the imagination, that like he's either going to be lauded for being a straight talker, who isn't afraid to say what everybody else is thinking. Or he's going to be seen as the secret genius who's going to finally do the D class this week. And you can tell because the number 17 appeared on the screen.

Unknown 1:09:48
But but but but but the badness but the fact that he's did we all know that he's just pretending to be president and he's he's good at staging these photo. He's not good at staging the photos. He's doing the photo there's no way where you look at it and you go he's staging that photo, but it's crazy because it drives us out of our minds and I go he's not he sucks at this he's not even good at it in the way that Obama was good at it. That's so appealing to his people. Like they fucking love that shit. They love it that the hogs they love it.

Unknown 1:10:17
They love to see it and because it's like there's nothing worse than that there's been elements of this and every I mean, I can I can play act as somebody who's from a lower middle class I'm because that's kind of where I'm from. Let's be honest, I'm from the lower middle

Unknown 1:10:28
class do the we do the accent we do the I

Unknown 1:10:34
feel very strongly about a Donald Trump

Unknown 1:10:38
that's an Ohio accent.

Unknown 1:10:40
So Sally, we should probably move on from this because it's not very funny but it's the other thing is like I do really I really don't like this The take on to I mean, it pushes my buttons that the that the sort of accepted take on Twitter is that these people are that like, what describes them is that they're racing and that they're primarily motivated by doing racism and the dots they wake up every morning and they go How can I do the most racist thing and that that it certainly looks like that like I understand it certainly appears that way like I get it yes but I actually don't think it's that I actually think these people I and then those then they flip out when they get those people foot by the way they get very offended they legit for real legitimately get very offended when you call them a racist because i don't i don't i mean some not the people who belong to Stormfront I mean there is a small percentage of them that actually are like primarily motivated by racist but that's like, I mean you're talking about like total in the country, like less than 10,000 people I think I mean it's not a they basically don't exist and

Unknown 1:11:42
most people who are legitimately racist are very proud to tell you that they are legitimately racist and setting aside as virtue signaling SJW say oh, well you're casually racist. Well, no, it's just they like seeing their big white boy win

Unknown 1:11:54
and and and there and also just real quick, they're doing racist actions. It's just that it's not the that's a byproduct. It's

Unknown 1:12:01
not motivated by the desire to be racist,

Unknown 1:12:03
right? They are racist, but they're not try it.

Unknown 1:12:07
Well, I don't know that that I don't I mean, it depends how you want to how you want to how you want to slice that thing. But there's the J smooth, there's that there's the J smooth thing of like, he's like, it's not helpful to tell people that are racist it but it is helpful to tell people that they're doing a racist action, right? Because when you say to someone, you are racist, they go, Oh, well, then the die is cast. And so I'm okay. I guess I might as well be either they have no reason to stop. This is why sometimes I

Unknown 1:12:28
feel like I'm up against the wall with phrases like homophobia, where like, oh, man, homophobia is such a lame word for what's actually happened. It

Unknown 1:12:36
makes no sense.

Unknown 1:12:38
Well, because it's one thing to say that you are claustrophobic. And where you have a phobia of small places, or being enclosed in something, but homophobia used to describe, like, legitimate hatred of the idea of homosexuality and homosexuals is really lame. I mean, definitely homophobia. That's that's hatred, like, call that what it is. And then same way, like I mean, with the with the racism stuff, and this is why I mentioned a long time ago, and I feel like, I sound like an idiot. But that's what Remember when I said that, like, what is it that motivates Jeff Sessions? At the time? Like, is he really that motivated? Or what motivates mitch mcconnell? I think mitch mcconnell likes to win. I think he's just I think he's a scrapper who likes to win.

Unknown 1:13:19
He just must be some sort of sociopath because he but this thing, he has one like, what I yes, it's baffling. I don't know. And it's kind of scary to me. That's the he's like the one guy where I'm like, why I

Unknown 1:13:34
think these people want I think they want cultural and I mean, so I think I know everyone's gonna get mad at me for this. But I think these people basically want the same thing we want, which is cultural and economic power. And there's only so much of that to go around, and someone's going to have it and there's going to be haves, and there's going to be have nots,

Unknown 1:13:49
but it's a zero sum game for them, where if somebody else wins a little bit, you will feel like you lost a lot.

Unknown 1:13:53
Well, so. So here's where I would differ a little bit on that. So the first thing is, it is a a zero sum game, that people have cultural and economic power, or they don't, and there is not enough for everyone, under our current system, and the system is set up that way. That's how we've got the world setup. But that being said, the reason I think that they fly off the handle is that if you have all of the cultural and economic power, and then you lose a little bit, if you lose your mind, right, what then if you go to a fair distribution, it seems like you're on the bottom,

Unknown 1:14:23
nothing. But that could be prone, it could be pronouns, that could be just simply acknowledging that somebody should be allowed to name themselves and say who they are. That by itself is the beginning. But what is prone I like all of these battles to me, I could take us to I'm trying to take a step back and and go, what is pronouns? Like? Is anyone really? Is that really what we're mad about? Or is it really that you have trans people who are have chosen the battlefield of pronouns? The pool? I mean, before you're allowed to buy a house, you have to have a seat at the lunch counter. It's not none of this stuff happens in Ryan, part of it is to tell the world who you are, rather than being told by other people who you are, and then, you know, it's a new kind of read. Well,

Unknown 1:15:02
that's, and that's why that's why I know you did exactly it. And it's like, I don't really think that America like cares that much about pronouns. In the same way. I don't think America really cared that much about lunch counters. But I think we all just to just to say the obvious like, we all know that this is a proxy battle for a much bigger cultural war, like what we're really talking about.

Unknown 1:15:21
The only reason I brought up pronoun, the only reason I brought up pronouns is that's one where I've arrived at, you know, what, it does not cost me fucking anything to call somebody what they want to be called right costs. And, boy, I'm really I'm really virtuous to be able to say that, but it's like, why can't other people just go like this? It's not a zero sum game like that for me, like, do I do I lose cold?

Unknown 1:15:41
No, no, no, it's not the pronouns are zero sum. It's not that the pronouns are a zero sum game. It's that it's that I think there are people in this country who feel like if, if there are trans people who can be out and have full human rights, that it threatens their their cultural hegemony, that they no longer have complete control over all economic multicultural control over right

Unknown 1:16:02
over how everything works in America, if a woman can be a counselor about what to do with a baby in the future act that even the idea of that counseling, let's talk about abortion, like abortion. Do you think like abortion is not about abortion, abortion is about sex. It's about it's about sex. It's about sex without consequences. It's about babies. Third, it's about fetuses. Second, and it's about women first. It's about being able to fuck with women and their economic viability and their power.

Unknown 1:16:26
Well, I Well, yes. And also we do an Alex.

Unknown 1:16:31
And also it's about Yes, it's like it's Yeah, its cultural and economic power. And then it's also like, it's also this thing of like, oh, women shouldn't be able to have sex without consequences. That's only something that men should be able to have.

Unknown 1:16:42
I think you guys are talking, not acknowledging that there are two different types of people like the people who are actually transphobic and fear, like, because they've been raised to fear people who are different and think that yes, you are, they are going to take my my child and molest them behind the dumpster. And then there's Mitch McConnell, who is yes, he if he loses that scrap of power it he dies inside. But that that is where I don't know. It's like, Where Where does this sociopathy begin of like using that fear to to have that power? And then, but then actually having that fear?

Unknown 1:17:24
When is it tribalism versus when

Unknown 1:17:27
is it tribalism? Where is it because there are people who are genuinely afraid of black people and genuinely afraid of gay people? And it's absolutely absolutely insane. And the mitch mcconnell he doesn't not want women to have power because he doesn't give a fuck, he wants him himself that power. But there I, Alex, it's hard. It's hard for me to believe. Do you really think that like, a lot of Americans think that trans people will molest their children? Or do you think that they, they don't want trans people to have rights and in order for them to achieve that political goal, they're gonna say, they're going to say whatever they need to say. And one of those things is I'm worried That's what I'm saying. These are two different types of people. There are people who if there weren't people who truly absolutely believed that the and that number is shrinking, and they're real, like, everyday that number shrinks, but also then the number of growth of like, oh, if I say this, I can get more people to believe me, I can get more people in my tribe. But if that feel that inherent fear wasn't there, what would that how would it start? You know, like, you're not gonna

Unknown 1:18:33
like turret like church. Church, to me is a good example of this. Because like the turfs don't believe any I don't think they believe any of this stuff about trans people. I think they just feel like oh, well, if trans people get full rights, then we lose that then our little corner of the movement loses some power. Exactly. But there's there has to be some there. There's like patient zero, right? Like, there's someone who comes out

Unknown 1:18:54
you sort of saying like you couldn't you couldn't fake that kind of strong feeling unless it came.

Unknown 1:18:57
I truly don't think that you could did not start somewhere. And that,

Unknown 1:19:03
to me is the fear. It's not like fear as in catching a cold this fear of Frankenstein's monster.

Unknown 1:19:08
Yeah, kind of fear. Yeah. It's I think part of the I think part of the fear is to the extent that it's real, which I'm not 100% sure about, part of the fear is that have you seen that clip? I retweeted occasionally. But it's the I can't remember her name, but it's the woman who was like a lecture about racism. And she said, How many white people in this room would like to be treated? How this country treats black folks? Mm hmm. Yeah, you're talking about no one raises their hand, and she does the fact that no one raises your hand tells me, you know, exactly. We all know exactly what we're talking about. Right. So I think that part to the extent that people fear like trans people, black people, any of these, you know, Muslims, immigrants, any of these minority groups, part of the fear is bound up in the way of like, you see how poorly society treats them. And then you're like, well, if they get power, I'll be treated that way.

Unknown 1:19:56
And I can't, when people say that, what they're really saying is, I don't want to become the other that proceed them.

Unknown 1:20:00
They're sort of a third group, though, because the there's all those people who they it's not that they don't like white people in there. They don't want to be treated like them. And we all know what you're talking about. But there's another it's like, there are all these people who it's like, oh, yeah, I'm not racist. But if your kid dates a black person, oh, god, oh, I'm fine with I'm just being practical. Yeah. I mean,

Unknown 1:20:26
I just don't want their life to be difficult.

Unknown 1:20:28
That's but that's like, the truth. Like, my parents like they Yeah, no, totally fine. But then when you realize what your kid is going to have to live with, or and that's kind of the part I do think that parents truly many truly were afraid not. Some definitely are afraid of like some transfer sound like raising their kid behind a trash can. But they are more afraid of their somehow go going to be convinced, oh, yeah, this dancing and stuff. That's cool. That's an awesome lifestyle. And then they then their child loses power. And they're, we've we've got ourselves set up in a way where it's where if you have a lot, it's amazing. And if you don't have a lot, it's hell, it's awful. It's untenable. And we all kind of know that. We all kind of fear being on the wrong side of that. And I think that's, that's explaining everything you said, when people are like, Oh, well, I'm not a racist, but I wouldn't want my daughter to date a black guy. What they're saying is like, right now we're on top, and I don't want her to take any action that would result on her being fault, you know, moving moving that far down. And to me, it's like, well, I'm the one you know, it's like, yeah, that that is that's what I mean. I'm not saying that's right. But it is rooted in fear.

Unknown 1:21:43
No, well, right. But it's, but it's not but all I'm saying is like, it's it's the dad, the dad who says that, right? Like it's not motivated by the fact that he he hates black people and he wakes up every day going, how can I press black people? It's that it's that he's scared of the justice in the world, which is a real, it's really scary. Like I'm scared of that

Unknown 1:22:04
you don't think it's probably they just wants to keep up property values. You know what I mean? That's that's like, No, no, I mean, I don't hate I don't hate black people. Well, meaning this as soon as the black people start moving into my neighborhood that starts affecting me not because I hate black people because I want to retain my home

Unknown 1:22:19
value. But this whole this whole the whole this whole fundamental like cultural and economic like inequity piece that I'm talking about, like one of the big tools there's property values, like we've put a number on it so that it can be measured and we can be scared of we can have a proxy war like that's the lunch counters have of all I don't want my I don't want where I live to lose cultural and economic power. I'm just saying like a lot like it's just it's just I just anyway, it's just I don't even know why we originally got it. I can't even remember the thing that originally got us talking about this, but it's just to me, I think all of us to take a step back like the whole reason I brought this up and this is to be clear all going to be edited out.

Unknown 1:23:16
Read about God knows dog Luna.

Unknown 1:23:20
Know, who should read about it. OG Jones? You know, the No, no, the woman who writes for the New Yorker, she's really good. And they did a feature in decibel about her dog Luna meal. It's really good. It's really good.

Unknown 1:23:33
Why isn't there an article about my cat? I'm Seamus podcaster.

Unknown 1:23:39
She has described this on in 2018. Luna was the subject of a New Yorker radio, our radio our very good show, in which Tolentino called her quote and effectively Bad dog. And she jumps on people and but she's she's a sweet, precious angel. She's appear nice. MC, what a mess up your knees mixed with a border collie. Whoo, that's gonna be a handful.

Unknown 1:24:00
Yo, let's get into the challenge. Hey, I

Unknown 1:24:03
got this dog. It's a

Unknown 1:24:05
challenge. The challenge this week was my challenge. I picked a challenge submitted by a friend of the show, john, and not that john the other one. And John's challenge was you instead of using one big call us to some small towels and he sent us a really nice email with some clarifying information. And basically what he said is he he does not get fully dry from one towel. And so by using like one towel, and then that towel absorbs the first level of you know, it's like a it's like when the ants need to cross a river, and they just throw themselves into the water and then they walk over their corpses. First Game of Thrones human way. Right. It's like you're sacrificing the first towel so that the second towel can actually draw you off. And I follow the logic there and then he also said he gets the towels get like Neil Dooley and they steal one big towel kind of never fully dries. And I do I think you would I get where you'd have that problem that you lived in like like a you're a tropical climate climate or Florida or something like that. You know? Now did you guys did you guys try this? Were you into it?

Unknown 1:25:06
Did you Did I want to just mention in passing I had a friend also named john in college. I was closer friends with his roommate Chris. Hi Chris Coleman if you're out there, and but john always said that he Chris would be like why are there so many towels in the bathroom and he says I get wetter than other people. And Chris always thought that was an odd thing to say. But I like your friend john. I think there are people let's put it let's put it another way. I don't know if they are empirically scientifically wetter than other people. But I think there are people who would prefer a higher level of dry and I think he's on the right track with with this like you treat yourself to two towels. I think that's nothing wrong with that.

Unknown 1:25:45
Now, here's the other thing I have a lot to say about towels. I'm probably not going to find on the podcast to get into it but most towels are really bad. Like the amount of when I go to my friends houses and I stay with my friends and their towels suck so much as they don't

Unknown 1:25:58
like pillows where people you want a soft pillow. You don't want a soft pillow you want it you want it you want us you want a

Unknown 1:26:05
pillow yes hard pillow hard towel you want to tell that will just are the hello hello hello can be the been pillow I want to tell a little damage me I want I want to tell it puts a hurtin on me I want it to realize what you what you

Unknown 1:26:18
want. You want

Unknown 1:26:22
one of those like cotton towels and that really that those are great looped Alina they have a little loops on them looped the little micro loops and they're made of

Unknown 1:26:33
you don't mean it's like I thought you meant like I'm OEBS towel.

Unknown 1:26:36
Oh no, no. Okay, all right. No, no, I mean, like,

Unknown 1:26:40
like, like, like, you know, honestly hotel towels can be great because they've been washed so many times all the softness is out. And now there's just raw scraping dryness potential.

Unknown 1:26:51
To get all soft

Unknown 1:26:52
and I'll be getting there was some dial soap and then finish yourself off of those towels. God take a layer of skin off now you're clean for a minute, but just the boy dirty and dirty inside you carry that with you.

Unknown 1:27:04
I don't I don't have this problem. I get fully dry from one towel. And so the two small towels versus one big towel did not help me. And based on my wife and my bathroom. My towels do dry lately. Actually, to be fair since the entire time we've had this challenge. I've been living in hotel rooms and I just throw my because I care about the earth. You're my house on the ground.

Unknown 1:27:25
How about you? How are you Alex? Do you really need to really get in there?

Unknown 1:27:29
All right here. Some people do get wetter and it's because of hair thickness like

Unknown 1:27:35
you start a podcast with Syracuse where you can talk about your your students

Unknown 1:27:40
the well he talks about the bar I'm talking about the upstairs not like he is just the fuzzy man. From what I've seen. Actually no you really need to get on Instagram just to see the pictures at Syracuse it takes and the pictures taken of Syracuse because he is very much a snack man he is a handsome handsome man huh?

Unknown 1:27:59
He's like a first trap account he

Unknown 1:28:00
really does um anyway.

Unknown 1:28:04
The Circus is becoming an Instagram thought he

Unknown 1:28:08
how we know we know if he's a mood right now. He's everything could he be everything possible he could be a mood he's a snack is a snack man

Unknown 1:28:16
he's

Unknown 1:28:18
I can't I can't I can't even I can't even with him

Unknown 1:28:20
You can't even with him. Oh that's a shame and everything right now.

Unknown 1:28:24
I need to find this Okay, anyway the the issue I've always had with tells is they are I don't get them that wet except for one particular spot which is the hair spot that head area and it's then it's just like the middle of my towel is basically sopping wet and then the rest no problem getting dry. But this so this this very few challenges that have changed my life. But this one to medium tells you've got one hair towel and then one I only need a small towel for the rest so basically, I like take the big soppy like and not the big but the the medium sized soppy towel and that goes on the good like the space in my bathroom where something will actually dry because I'm a monster and usually like using a new towel every day because I hate I hate dolphins but now no like everything is fully dry and then it's like fluffy and new. So I have been using to medium sized like hand towels and especially because in hotels and I haven't wanted housekeeping or anything like that. There's a lot more small small towels than big towels which doesn't make sense but it has worked out for me so this was a great challenge although challenge it did not the results were not what I expected. Like I don't get too wet all over.

Unknown 1:29:49
I don't you have such a short haircut. I think it's strange to me that your hair gets that much water was

Unknown 1:29:54
fucking hell. It was held Merlin it was Oh, it was hell bad. Having long hair. Sorry. Oh, triggered me now. Geez, no cry. Oh, do you ever have nightmares about hair?

Unknown 1:30:11
hair? Hair hair?

Unknown 1:30:12
No, no, no, not really. What about you, man? If you can say what happens in your hair nightmares?

Unknown 1:30:18
Oh, no, I just have ears. I literally have nightmares about my hair growing back and being very long. And apparently this is also a very common dream for like a lot of queer men women because it's like, ah, going back to that period. But lots of men have it to it and i don't i don't know why I don't like having a lot of hair too much too much. It's too much.

Unknown 1:30:38
You know, like in a bachelorette party. Sometimes they have a penis shaped cake. Yes. The other night I had a dream about a cake shaped penis.
