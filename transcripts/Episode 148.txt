One and a half diet cokes.

Unknown 11:11
And then another cup I got.

Unknown 11:14
Okay, so really Let me paint a picture for you.

Unknown 11:21
It's from the ELO brand of sippy cups, because it's easier for me to say it because I only have one hand right now. And then on my right, I have two cans of Diet Coke. One is one of those cute cans that you like to hold and think you're a giant and one is a normal size. And I couldn't tell which one was colder. So I took them both. And that's why now but also it's very upsetting plus the sippy cup.

Unknown 11:47
cup I got what I supposed to stay hydrated so water and delicious, nutritious drink Diet Coke. The

Unknown 11:53
human brain is just a fantastic machine.

Unknown 11:58
does need occasionally this

Unknown 12:00
is fascinating. I think this one's called a

Unknown 12:03
little tune up from time to time what's colder. I'll

Unknown 12:05
take both

Unknown 12:10
Oh, I like

Unknown 12:14

Unknown 12:17

Unknown 12:26
Making connections or

Unknown 12:27

Unknown 12:29

Unknown 12:30
control command power button on Alex.

Unknown 12:34

Unknown 12:36
Just cycle or just just singing a little little tune? Yeah, yeah, so what cold

Unknown 12:41
beverages?

Unknown 12:44
Yeah. All right. All right. Oh, there's there's like a perfect there was a perfect temperature up it's a real it's a real question. It's not a bit there's like a perfect fridge. freezer temperature depending on your choice where you can put a can and for 30 minutes and it doesn't freeze over but it comes all like up like a slushy. And it's just magical without the sun nice.

Unknown 13:08
Oh, that's that's my dorm fridge here at the office is whatever that temperature is. It is that it's dorm

Unknown 13:12
fridges guys

Unknown 13:14
yeah, cuz I have the tiniest little bit of ice and every seltzer at I noticed

Unknown 13:18
it was so good. And I'm like, is this this real? Sure a bug and

Unknown 13:24
I keep it I keep it. It's like what's like a blood? Boy? I gotta keep it right on the edge. I want I want it to be I want it to be compliant. But yeah, I don't want it to be explosive. So you know, back in the day, I put a 12 pack of bush in bottles into a you know, a freezer, that's a bad idea. Especially if you've been drinking, you don't put glass in the freezer. That's a bad idea. But you can get your fridge to be just where you'd like it to be because they're not well made there. They're simple machines, you know? But uh, yeah, like a cold beverage.

Unknown 13:52
Oh,

Unknown 13:53
are you doing okay? You seem like you're doing all right. Your work?

Unknown 13:55
Oh, no, I am I am recording this podcast this.

Unknown 14:02
You do make money, though. The

Unknown 14:05
this month? Yeah. Not this month? Because normally I would be I would be doing work. Yeah, I didn't it was Cameron. So great. I didn't have to touch any buttons, because I came and sat down in studio for a real long second thought. Which one do I sit at? So that's where I am? Wow. I

Unknown 14:26
have a question that I've been putting off of it. Go for it. Feel free to cut this out if it's inappropriate. I mean, you had a you had a medical procedure on your human hand. Has this given you any new opportunities for medical robotic appliances? Do you get like a special AI pointing sticker? Anything? Is there anything that you got to be a little bit more robotic as your meat body fails you a little bit.

Unknown 14:52
Unfortunately, it went better than expected. So I know. However, however, was there a plan B to give you a real

Unknown 15:05
if you some people if they have like if they can't remove the tumor, they put in a little device that shoots out radiation at scheduled time. It's like the Internet of Things of tumors, just put it right in your hand. And so I've had to go every morning to get like my little tumors apt until now to meet and tiny tumors no more. But I really wanted as a strong word. But you know, if I had to have it, I wouldn't have been against the new miracle technology that is putting a little radiation machine into my hand. However, however, this the pain honestly, though, not that bad. And I keep thinking if I wanted to put a medical device like you know, an NFC chip, which is totally definitely a medical device. It wouldn't hurt that bad. You just like

Unknown 15:54
Oh, you mean to do it yourself a little homebrew project little life hacking.

Unknown 15:57
Exactly. And especially what like my hand looks like now it does look like I slashed it open and sewed it back together. So I could just say Oh, it happened to the other hand. Oh, so it's Yeah, I've got a running list for Dr. Don about like cleanliness and medical procedures. So we'll see how that turns out what what

Unknown 16:18
toxic people you go to hospitals for sick people is the worst place

Unknown 16:20
to go. But this one was so clean. Anyway. Really? They didn't get the substance or anything?

Unknown 16:26
I hope not. Or Jen Kevin. Oh, wait, wait, you Kevin was at PAX I was you were at PAX or you can't carrying anything. I didn't get sick.

Unknown 16:35
You have the germ. I know. There's no concrete. No con plague. I hope Listen, I don't like to talk about this because I think if I do talk about it eventually it'll unmake itself and I'll Jinx myself forever. But I don't typically get sick after shows.

Unknown 16:52
I have I have a decent immune system. Let's go and say that. And now that I've said it out loud. It's all

Unknown 16:58
Bye. You're totally so

Unknown 17:00
sick. Although after Gen Con. I did get sick for like four hours. I had maybe the most fit full night's sleep I've ever had I sweat more than I've ever sweat in my life. Like in my bed. I was like I'm getting the flu. I'm gonna die.

Unknown 17:14
You might be going through menopause.

Unknown 17:16
That's what I was like, Why do I feel like

Unknown 17:19
do you find yourself watching The Golden Girls?

Unknown 17:22
Be honest. Yeah, no, that's that's suck. It's it sucks to be sick in a hotel room. I feel like we're always talking about hotel rooms. Oh, it's like hellish. Well, it is because like, there's so much there's so much. I feel like when I go to a hotel room. I'm not trying to do a bit. But like, there's so much in that it's so foreign that we just kind of look past there's so much you don't you're just not going to think about about a hotel room. But I find if I'm feeling away, it will say maybe I drank too much even but like especially if you're like getting sick and you're like oh shit. I'm getting sick in a hotel room and I'm here for two nights this really sucks to me the foreignness it becomes live like what like some kind of like a Julianne Moore movie, like suddenly the entire place feels very dangerous and ominous to me. Like down to the I never think about the bedspread. Never think about the beds. Just don't think about it and like and there's just so much you know, don't think because normally if you're fine, right like you don't think about it but to me that's when I get really super loopy and become like I'm in a 90s movies I started thinking a lot about like what's happening and paranoia little bit Yeah, well I mean like you know, it's it's so foreign and strange and sometimes it's way too quiet and sometimes is way too loud. And like what's up with those curtains and like

Unknown 18:35
you don't you don't have any resources you know, I got I got my specific my specific meds and you gotta go get the meds. And you know, all hotels have that like little crappy shop where everything costs like 19 to $35 and it's all expired and covered in sticky. That's like

Unknown 18:51
a $48 Imodium, I have a sick I have a sick box at home. I wrote about this website 43 folders. I think it's a good idea to have a box that aside of like all of the stuff you are going to want to comfort yourself. Absolutely a cold. Yeah, it makes it get a banker's box. I don't care where you sleep, but have all this stuff. Well, you don't know what I'm gonna kid I don't really have any room for anything that I like. So it's boxes fallen into disrepair. But no, usually in the outlet and closet, but it could be stuff like okay, here's the thing. First Aid Kit. A first it's like,

Unknown 19:22
yeah, yeah, so you're describing a first aid kit. But this like, I

Unknown 19:25
feel like you know, I'll speak for myself if I'm getting a cold and I need to power through. I'll have me a daytime therapy, flu. No therapy, flu basically it's like running night Burning Night true. Like I'm not I don't feel like myself, but I don't feel dead. And sometimes that's the preference. But guess what, you probably forgot you're out of Thera flu. So lucky. Make sure you got their flu. You put that in the box, you could eat whatever is like your comfort things you're going to want. Make sure it's like having a second set of cables. Like you really want to have this somewhere and don't touch it. It's a go bag for getting sick. And you don't have it like Jen said you're stuck in that room with all those microbes in that bedspread. You guys the bedspread.

Unknown 20:07

No, because because the problem is well what is Burning Man? It's like desert Super Bowl for tech. douchebags. Right? And so you go and it's really costing you run around and you wear goggles. And it's playing, man Shut up. And and so the problem is why does you find something you you you want it to fuck or have a deep conversation with, but like you were tripping? They were tripping? And like, maybe that person was like a third of a dragon. It's like, how do you find them? There are a lot of dragons. Were there. That was just that was a guess.

Unknown 26:51
Yeah, that was that was a good. Good job. Here's a good one. Hold on, hold on.

Unknown 26:58
This sounds kind of silly, but I noticed a camp that was raccoons themed two spots away from us around 3:45am and on eat during our strike day and I'm so sad. I never got to say hi. I'm a huge fan of raccoons. That's nice. Oh, here's a good one. We shared a sunrise Friday morning at Burning Man We met at the trash.

Unknown 27:22
The girl from the social mixer who had free kisses written across your chest. Oh, are you reading these? I'm just staring at the at the Burning Man Reddit page right now.

Unknown 27:40

Unknown 28:16
Black pill. I think it's just like they wanted to be more hardcore. And me and scary. They're the ones who are not been enough. Yeah, I could be wrong. I'm not familiar with all of the pills other than the ones I'm on right now.

Unknown 28:29

Unknown 29:19
Where are you there? Why do you go there I might my my, my extension for blocking websites broke what and I and I stopped using Chrome. But it used to be I could just ban websites. And I could say I just want to see it. And so for years and years and years, I just even see Reddit because it was always it became like up there with Wikipedia in returns. And so I just stopped thinking about Reddit until you people every week you talk about Reddit and some thing and it's like, it's you guys.

Unknown 29:47
This company has forced me to be on Reddit, you gotta

Unknown 29:50
get off it. And I don't want to hear a single word about how some of them are good. Everyone keeps saying that. My that's a number one HR complaint. I need Facebook for my work.

Unknown 30:00
I saw you standing there by yourself and your red coat. I said I liked your coat. And you turned to me and said You lost your pink bike with a Polaroid camera and it was specific I helped you find it and we spent some time afterwards visiting the temple and writing down our wishes.

Unknown 30:13
What the fuck is Burning Man? We

Unknown 30:16
see the sunrise together but I didn't see you at our meeting location. We only had two hours of sleep so I figured you didn't wake up in time. I wish we exchanged our contact information because I felt a connection with you. I hope we cross paths cross paths again. Okay, so these are

Unknown 30:30
like no I found one that's a woman really really presumably Time Lord slash Francesca searching for sunshine slash Seth that's it you go to Burning Man you pick your burning. Burning.

Unknown 30:43
Man is Jerry Jerry Jarrett. Gerald Gerald

Unknown 30:50
steam POC name

Unknown 30:55
Starbucks name

Unknown 31:10
last last night in order an empanada at a new place awesome place and the woman said What's your name? He said Bob interested? And I said and I feel like kind of a dig she's really nice. She's my order name. She says yeah, he says I use Bob sometimes to to tell that is the only name anybody ever needs to give.

Unknown 31:29
But I No no, no, no. Why was Merlin attract too much attention? The name

Unknown 31:34
was act like your act like you're a racist white man in my neighborhood and do an impression of someone in my neighborhood say Merlin.

Unknown 31:40
I understand that but why did you talk and tell the person that's a bob that's not my real name.

Unknown 31:48
really low key I whispered it just like it did no.

Unknown 31:53
real close I said to my daughter.

Unknown 31:56
And she replied I do too. Yeah, I I do that. You'll never find

Unknown 32:03

Unknown 32:08
Like Merlin man from Dubai Friday

Unknown 32:14
fellow bombs bombs

Unknown 32:18
I don't I don't like to give a name for my order. Could you just write something complimentary about Donald Trump on the bag?

Unknown 32:27
Did you see this is forever ago I thought you saw this this might be one of those things from my corners of the internet. But uh, someone posted a photo of like their takeout bag and it said BLM on it and they were like oh wow this this Chinese Place Order from is totally walk it says Black Lives Matter and they were like no I just ordered

Unknown 32:53
imagine the disappointment oh my god black

Unknown 32:59
Oh my yes all lives matter.

Unknown 33:04
So anyway, yeah, you're right. I shouldn't have done that. But sometimes we feel like I I might if I'm gonna have a relationship with somebody in the neighborhood over time. I want them to know I you know what, I shouldn't it's dumb, but I feel like I want them to know I'm providing Bob to you as a service but then when I talk about

Unknown 33:22
how I gave this for you, I'm

Unknown 33:24
doing this for you because I love you. Now when I when I when I explain why I'm doing it. I guess that sounds weird and creepy. Especially if I lean in to gain their confidence

Unknown 33:35
for you because I love you.

Unknown 33:37
Because I love you and I'll be back this epic not is for me. I promise. The churros are for my daughter

Unknown 33:47
I swear she's real

Unknown 33:48
I can dump her if we need to do what time do you get off?

Unknown 33:54
Camera

Unknown 34:00
KS la significant day Bob.

Unknown 34:03
Oh, we should start this show.

Unknown 34:06
We haven't been recording.

Unknown 34:08
Oh, that was that was comedy gold.

Unknown 34:12
You guys suck. Oh my god.

Unknown 34:14
Do you think time do you

Unknown 34:15
think the pumpkin is coming? I don't know. Nathan steam punk. Oh, you put the steam punk in Look at that. There it is. That was a funny bit. It was okay. No, no, you didn't watch it. What do you know we're talking about? I had a little fun with steam punk.

Unknown 34:30
Oh Jen, you don't even I don't know. Let's play a second of this. Oh.

Unknown 34:38
I do a lot of keep all my tools and I put together

Unknown 34:43
what do you like 20 here like that. You know that I am a tremendous ardent fan of steampunk literature, steampunk culture. It's for me it's a lifestyle we know this is such a big piece of how I've kind of put my live together and I just I really believe in the authenticity of kind of getting it right and and and making it part of who you are. You know, it's not just kind of a weekend costume event for me.

Unknown 35:12
Or our steampunk glasses I don't know how well you can see that. But these actually are made these frames are made out of the writing desk of Jules Verne

Unknown 35:25
because they've retained a lot of water and been moved the desk had been moved a lot it's they're not ideal for this so they they couldn't they're very fragile you know I you could not put prescription lenses in the because really good magnification would have would have put too much stress on the vintage

Unknown 35:47
vision of you know seeing who you are. But my big the vision of steampunk is very much

Unknown 35:56
I would I would know I'm really so everywhere have a have a steampunk steamboat?

Unknown 36:05
Is this the most convenient way to get around? No, there's not water you know in a lot of the middle part of San Francisco so again, I'm not here for convenience I'm here you know if I may say to kind of keep an imperial to keep it real if you like and so and so I don't want to shortcut this. I've had a hang up in the past because I love masturbation it's something that just for me, but it's I've had a problem because I haven't had

Unknown 36:34
a reliably steam called way to

Unknown 36:39
other part of my life

Unknown 36:44
becomes frustrating for me, but I've come up with a solution.

Unknown 36:53
Oh no.

Unknown 37:00
historical documents

Unknown 37:03
catch up on my Merlin. Yeah.

Unknown 37:09
I got a lot to catch up on these

Unknown 37:19
kind of a camera.

Unknown 37:22
Camera, especially if you know what you want to say but just stand where it's funny.

Unknown 37:26
Some people are with you because they're they're waiting for the diving catch. People don't catch

Unknown 37:37
these comments on this video.

Unknown 37:40
The Internet used to be nice the internet you see nice here was fun. I

Unknown 37:43
laughed so hard You will not believe tears are running down with

Unknown 37:49
that's brilliant.

Unknown 37:50
Tell her about Phone Guy someday.

Unknown 37:53
Man, I can't wait to watch tactical internet pants.

Unknown 38:01
Now

Unknown 38:05
we get back into character.

Unknown 38:06
I have I have like an almost real question. In the days where you were a public speaker. Yeah. What sort of did you take from that into like the internet funny bits because you were our art sorry, our public speaker and and then

Unknown 38:26
rip to a real one. There's a photo of us together. He did. He's dead.

Unknown 38:30
I love him. My first my first job opening for him.

Unknown 38:36
Oh my god. Here's a real one.

Unknown 38:42
The original Steve.

Unknown 38:45
Oh my god. Here's a photo of us. I love him.

Unknown 38:50
died recently and it made me mad.

Unknown 39:00
Oh god.

Unknown 39:12
Yeah, the photos. It just gets me Oh, just waiting to see why this is trending. I thought Fredo lay it died.

Unknown 39:21
My favorite I've seen tweet. I know you guys covered this again. Yeah, fertile fertile ground for your album. My favorite Epstein tweet was Wow, if you really did kill himself. It's a really good friend. Used to be so

Unknown 39:38
nice. Setting my.

Unknown 39:42
But really to John's question, how do you see you when

Unknown 39:46
How do you not hate yourself enough to look at to film your face? Yeah, that and

Unknown 39:51
and you're just really, really good at it?

Unknown 39:55
Well, thanks. I don't like putting anything on the internet anymore. It's just not fine. I mean, it's really it's really not fun. Everything has become Twitter. Everything has become drum. And it's it's so sad because it used to be. I don't know, maybe you know what I was naive at a and privilege, naivete in a sense of not really thinking through what shit could happen and having it not happen enough that it didn't trouble me. But then also just like it's the privilege of like, I can't now Alex, I'm finally reading that Jia Tolentino book, like thinking about just thinking about, like her point that like women have always had to think a lot about how they present themselves for millennia, let alone in the internet age. But yeah, I mean, it's just not fun anymore. I mean, anything, everything is not fun. And so like, I keep going back to Twitter, because like it used to be, you could, like people, if you had a bit, people would take a minute to understand the bid before they tried to play along. But that's an old thing on a forum right here. Back in the day on a forum, somebody had a little bit of a bit, and there'd be bits on a forum. And people would play along, because they understood the bit. And now more and more, it just everything stops with in seconds. Because of the classic like explaining your joke to you or of like I never understood I don't know how I've looked at Twitter don't understand think saying?

Unknown 41:09
Okay, that's good. You know, you can google stuff. You know,

Unknown 41:12
there's no moment where people read the room. Correct?

Unknown 41:15
Yeah, that's a really good way to put it. It's like, yeah, I mean, well, it's also you know, thinking about I was I was taking a shit the other day and thinking about this. And I was thinking, that's not really germane to the story, but but it helps me understand my process a little bit, is like, I was just thinking about how like, there are always different angles, where you can make something stupid, or you could try to make it into your thing, and the way that you like to do your thing. Like maybe you're like, yeah, I'm a potted Fern, and I respond as a Fern, that kind of shit. But like, every there are different angles you can take. But the best of these things is when more than one person does read the room, as you say, understands what the bit is. And then people build on the bit in a way that it is generative, rather than the sort of you know, people will yes and with you because they understand what to do rather than trying to turn it into something that it's not that they to make it something they can understand. I mean, it should posting can be funny, but it's just it's not cool. There was a meta meta filter thread that I still look at once a year that I love, that I could probably find. And it's one of my all time favorite meta filter threads where somebody had said something and then everybody risk it was it was dorky, but funny, every single person that responded was low enough volume that there was time for no dupes, or anything. Every person that responded is like, first person's response was like, you know, perfunctory comment from person saying first, second comment that every single person played along and you just keep reading and reading and reading and waiting for the tower to fall over for the Jenga to break, because somebody comes in and goes, What, why is everybody doing this? Why Why is why are people doing this? I never understand anything that's happening here. Because it would break the bit, you know, anyway, that's just not fun anymore. Why did I do it then? Be I didn't know what to be scared of. or concerned or hung up about? You know, the truth is I don't, I'm a white dude is 52. I'm not that hung up about how I look. I'm not but it's like, I don't want to have a conversation about things that are in the background of things. Like, it's so gross to me that like you can't take a minute to see the thing that you're trying to make this into your thing. And then more people trying to make it into their thing. And it's really fucking weird. And they want to make it into something weird. And then it's funny that they've made it weird. And it's like, You people are all the worst. And like, you deserve the cat you have.

Unknown 43:36
I feel supported. All right, fine. I'll zoom out of your garage. That looks very nice.

Unknown 43:42
Oh, God, see you're doing the thing.

Unknown 43:44
I know I'm exactly doing the

Unknown 43:46
way of comedy shows that cards if you like you guys mentioned this before, but before every show all the performers before they go on stage and do improv with each other. As they clap each other on the back and they go, I got your back, right. And then all of us that are working at the show also start to do it to each other because we like to we like to pretend work before. And I always think like, you know, this is the promise that like I'm not gonna let you go up on stage and fail, I will fail first, or I will participate in your bit, but I will not make you look or feel stupid. And every time I've seen the performance do that. I always think this is the opposite of Twitter. Yeah, yeah.

Unknown 44:22
Yeah, yeah, it's, it's, um, I understand this. I'm not gonna I'm not doing this as a bit. I understand. I don't like howard stern as a thing. I've lyst our stern it just seems mean and deliberately stupid. I know. He's beloved by people that I respect. But there's the bubble booty thing where apparently, when you get near a microphone or a camera, you say ba ba boom, I don't know what that means. But it's a shit post. It's a form of shit posting. And like, you know, if one person does that on the Today show a month. That's kind of funny. If everybody does that all the time without ever making their own today show it's not good. Somebody needs to have the temerity, the conference and the awareness to say like I'm going to create a percentage of them where my little show exists. And like and that will that will be this little special gossamer thing that lives for a little while until somebody comes along and yells probability, but like at this point, it's so exhausting to make a fucking anything because of all the Baba buoy. And just it's like I i I'm a pretty if I want to be I'm a pretty good shape poster. It can be very funny. But like just the whole need to come in and be the kid who runs on stage and takes a ship while someone's singing it's just like, where are we going with this? How does this turn out great fucking make something you piece of shit go do something.

Unknown 45:42
You go make something have have have the confidence that to marry have the have the stones to go fucking make something more than a pile of shit that you point at? Oh,

Unknown 46:08
this is not the show, right? This is this is not in the show.

Unknown 46:11
This isn't the show because I don't know how I got to like Gen Z Twitter the other day, but I was there.

Unknown 46:20
NZ Twitter again, Jim ZJE.

Unknown 46:24
The like, Generation Z like us? Yes.

Unknown 46:27
How do I google that? Yeah.

Unknown 46:31
The other day, I saw that there was a band called The end. And

Unknown 46:35
that's wrong. That's wrong.

Unknown 46:39
Just honestly just go to little masses, Twitter and

Unknown 46:44
little nods or little nods x Alex.

Unknown 46:50
Was my father little nice 10.

Unknown 46:55
People that like don't know what like the that. That Red Room in Stranger Things was I've never seen photos before.

Unknown 47:10
Paul McCartney was in a band before wings.

Unknown 47:15
That joke is all even that joke is 30 years old.

Unknown 47:19
Young kids, right? That's like Mike was my kid at Gen Z.

Unknown 47:23
You're I think your kid is like, sort of, I don't know. It's like 20 years old to 10 years old. So I think she's

Unknown 47:33
got a Benjamin Button thing going on? Okay.

Unknown 47:37
I don't know. Like their sense of humor. This is amazing. I haven't

Unknown 47:41
looked at little nozzles. Twitter. It's on August 30. He tweeted poop.

Unknown 47:49
So what a good

Unknown 47:51
thing. They like taking ship hosting, and they just make it their own thing and be like, you don't understand this. Oh, well. So good. And the like recursive memes. I don't know. I don't understand them. But I love them. And I was talking to my sister. And I was like, Okay, what this and she's like, I don't know, it's just funny. And it's like, they've taken all of the stuff that we've ruined about memes and the internet and the like you to notice of what Merlin's talking about. And they are making their own things and just, I don't know, it was really refreshing. Or I was high and

Unknown 48:30
I don't know,

Unknown 48:31
that can be that can be super fun. I mean, like, especially when it's in like, I'm just talking, you know, forums back in the day, or as you say, for like back in the day, like it was a fun thing. And there was so many like in jokes for that particular forum and in a certain way and like it became funny or online live journal was like this for me also. And then people would come like would come wheeling by and just be like, what is happening in here? Like, what is this room? What are you doing in here? And it's nice that that can still exist. Also it is more ship staying for fun in a vernacular is more resistant to being fucked with. Then for example, sincerity. Like when somebody comes on the next door, and I've never had the guts to do this on our next door, but when somebody comes on the next door and does the next door style bit, and like it's obviously being next door, it's it's people some people think it's really funny because they obviously get it and they're lurkers like me or they're like so mad and confused so I'm sure this is a secure channel that's only to be used for discussing blacks oh no children going door to door asking for candy haha it's kind of funny and they're like why do I have to report this to the police? They told me no one was supposed to be on the area. Do you have any footage that you could share with the group of these these children wearing of them blacks

Unknown 49:49
do we do they do that like share video footage?

Unknown 49:52
Oh dude on next door ring rings ring as a whole thing now it's a

Unknown 49:57
Oh yeah,

Unknown 49:58
it's all it's all rigged footage but also it's all links the thing is like if you want the uncut shit like if you want the really serious like put it in my vein shit you got to be on citizen here racism well i think it's what here's the thing citizen like if you the thing if you want to be so like our next door is all like package these like mostly package thieves and coyote in the area. And Did anybody see the accident at Dustin such Did I hear shots there's a lot of that. But But of course a lot of it is the like here's some ring footage of somebody on my porch kind of thing. But citizen is a thing that's in I think just San Francisco and New York Metro right now and it's um I guess they like monitor the scanner or something or 911 so you get push alerts about crime in your neighborhood immediately and so people get the citizen alert and then they screenshot that and drop it into next door and like anybody else see this on citizen so you get these multi levels of no one was supposed to be in the area type stuff.

Unknown 51:08
You start sharing intelligence

Unknown 51:08
on the guy who wears a helmet and carries a pointy stick around whereas he what happened with the restraining order on him there's the guy with the face tattooed down by the 711 has anybody dealt with him lately?

Unknown 51:21
Oh my God Oh no. I'm looking at just the screenshots from the App Store and oh my

Unknown 51:29
god in the App Store huh

Unknown 51:31
the no

Unknown 51:34
it's Yeah, it's only available in San Francisco

Unknown 51:37
Yeah, yes basically it shows you like on a map Yeah.

Unknown 51:42
Like a video hundred feet away child blocked in vehicle like as if that go do something like

Unknown 51:50
that's a perfect perfect way to put it Yes. I got

Unknown 51:55
somebody should do something about this. Somebody please think of

Unknown 51:58
the children I got it a little over the summer and I turned to my kid and I went oh my god and we both ran to the window an accident like two houses away we got a push notification about that's terrifying. No it's it's like oh, it's the pan optic on the pan pizza pan religious

Unknown 52:21
This is like in the dark in the Batman movie when he's like looking at all the crime yeah and the big screen you can see in his little

Unknown 52:32
Morgan Freeman's like this is

Unknown 52:35
mass mass of Bruce white why you looking into that changing room

Unknown 52:53
oh my god this app is fucking crazy.

Unknown 52:56
They like make it look ominous on purpose. Yeah,

Unknown 52:58
indeed in

Unknown 53:00
Yeah, I'm trying to look at some of the screen grabs I've gotten

Unknown 53:03
I gotta tell you this is this is making me feel

Unknown 53:07
bad.

Unknown 53:08
Yes. paranoid. paranoid. Yeah, I feel weird about this you Yeah, Star burger. burger. burger man what's burgling?

Unknown 53:18
Oh god there's a trailer Oh no, this is all going and showed a man I could totally see this ruining my life. This is who I am shocked that it hasn't ruined people's lives yet

Unknown 53:27
it will. I mean like all kidding and silly aside like you between the crime and safety section of next door and things like citizen it's not difficult to see like a little bit of dystopia right around the corner or to wonder what dystopia is out there right now that we just don't have a UI for like, what kind of shit is going on that we're just not even seeing?

Unknown 53:49
Okay, so they have a I'm seeing now citizen headquarters. So are you do you know if they like call 911 or if you're reporting stuff and then this group of people is just deciding what to put

Unknown 54:04
out? I think they're probably listening to a scanner because I'm trying I apologize I'm trying to find some screen grabs for you but I think they listen to a scanner because they will frequently be like oh there's an update to this in such story. Oh, I also and by the way, oh boy. By the way, if you have the citizen app and you get the push alert and you're close enough you can run and start streaming live video

Unknown 54:25
which is like some straight up 80s Robocop type shit

Unknown 54:29
I

Unknown 54:32
app that you can report lightning

Unknown 54:35
Yeah. Lightning

Unknown 54:41
dark sky about this dark sky

Unknown 54:47
this little literally does look like so they put it in night mode to yes like yeah,

Unknown 54:52
it's the most ominous of modes. It looks it looks like

Unknown 54:58
Hey, no incidents founded RK location. Good.

Unknown 55:01
All right, all right.

Unknown 55:04
pop up to 200 feet away man with gun at playground and then the woman just turns

Unknown 55:10
oh my god 200 feet away.

Unknown 55:13
Also, it makes the single best sound on iOS. I don't know how they come up. They somebody did a real good job with this sound. I can't even obviously I can't really describe it but you know usually you get a when you get to be spoke alert for a given app. It'll be like you know beep boop or whatever. And this one's like even even over even over the if you're listening to music or a podcast without headphones. It's like it's got this like haptic feeling to it. If you're listening on headphones. It sounds like somebody just hit you twice. It's really upsetting

Unknown 55:49
someone's dumping you in the back of the head

Unknown 55:57
this looks exactly like the Spider Man video game.

Unknown 56:01
Each villain is gonna look at this tower This is like literally Yeah.

Unknown 56:07

Unknown 57:05

Unknown 57:06

Unknown 57:08
You have a real husband you don't get to do that. I have a fake husband

Unknown 57:16
Alex Cox Wow.

Unknown 57:20
Give us your fucking money calm.

Unknown 57:21
I had never seen Nathan for you until about a week ago any of it at all. I had seen a couple clips you had shown me. But it was on Comedy Central. And I it was like in that that short period of my life where it was in pirating things, so I watch it. But recently, it was put on Hulu. And don't Don't worry, Jen, the microphone probably won't fall IO deadly just punched the microphone.

Unknown 57:48
I know it was I thought nobody noticed. And then Alex okay. I think

Unknown 57:53
it was the look of panic.

Unknown 57:57
Everything's gonna be okay. And I just started enjoying it. And I think this is technically Jen's challenge this week. Nope. No, no, I have no part of this. It should be

Unknown 58:07
it should be you know what, let's retro actively make a chance challenge.

Unknown 58:10
Oh, it's Jen. Shawn. Yeah, it's a challenge comes from Jen. Yeah. Can you explain before we get into specifically what the challenge was what Nathan for you is

Unknown 58:21
Oh, I've not prepared anything.

Unknown 58:25
This is for you is hosted by the sky Nathan fielder who went to business school and got really good grades. Canada, Canadian business. You know, I read an interview with him recently. And he said, someone asked him about like, Did you really get good grades? And he said in business school, or his particular business school you went to they let him negotiate grades because they're like in the business world, you can negotiate anything. So he said he would go to his professors and be like, Well, my bike broke and I fix the tires sort of calling a cab on my here so that shows initiative and I'm very enterprising and they'd be like, Okay, wow, I've seen him I've seen Nathan Nathan fielder do like a live show couple years ago he had a he like came and did a q amp a at Northwestern and it was like the best the best thing I've ever seen because he really is that guy. I think he definitely turns up the the awkwardness but he is like a genius at interviewing people and just leading them along to say something weird without, but we don't you know, what he does that I really like is he doesn't really interest people. He doesn't really trick them. He just lets them keep talking. Like no one can sit in an awkward silence Better than he can write

Unknown 59:40
the like, the the whole premise like yes, I will make your business better. I am funny businessman. Justin, it's cool. It's great. But and I thought it was hilarious. But then just watching him interview people is actually what got me and I'm like, I will never be able to interview anybody. Well, as he does,

Unknown 1:00:01
this is this is just just so people to two quick things gonna jump back. But two quick things. First of all, he was on john benjamin has a van, which is a very funny show. He was the john benjamin. You know, Bob's Burgers guy had a really good show called john benjamin has a band and he was an actor on that. And I recommend that to y'all. The other thing, and this already gets us into the way this show gets my head really, first of all, it's a total delight to watch. But there is this level of like, Huh, how much of this is what it seems to be? Because, as you say, the essential premise and then we're going to get super into this, I think because we have to and a couple episodes. But the premise that it's so flimsy, and it's the premise, if you stop for a minute to think about the premise, it doesn't make an ounce of sense, obviously, because the premise of the show is that he goes and fixes a business. He there's never any indication those people asked to have their business fixed, although maybe that's what happened. But like he obviously goes in the whole bit is he goes in, and he's gonna run in this business by adding his improvements to it. But there's not any real breaking of character to let us know how in on the bit those people were. Who if anybody is an actor, because in some cases, it's like if this person was an actor, that's hilarious. And this person wasn't an actor that walks right up to the level of mean and abusive. Do you see them with the haunted house making the haunted house scarier?

Unknown 1:01:26
There's one more there's one where he decides that this haunted house should be scarier. And so the way he makes the haunted house scarier is that they break character inside the haunted house to tell people they may have just gotten a communicable disease. They have to be rushed to that we rushed to the hospital by people that people meet them in hazmat suits, and won't that won't let them leave. And it goes on. And finally, it says on a house exit at the hospital. And then the bit of course, that's leading up to the bit which is he thinks it's good publicity for the haunted house, if someone Sue's them because the haunted house was too scary. And the way he seems to want to do that is having this African American couple go through this, you're like, Oh, god, that's awful.

Unknown 1:02:10
But then he doesn't like five more groups of people.

Unknown 1:02:16
Okay, I know this can't be 100 hundred percent real. How would you get a hospital created through this? I'm sorry, I went on longer than expected to, but that's part of the fun of the show. Is that how flimsy the premise is, they just run with the premise. But I can very rarely see the cracks of what is not with this show. And because it walks right up to the edge of truly mean and jackass or Ashton Kutcher. It's endlessly fascinating. Once you start thinking about this show, you are going to think you're gonna laugh and laugh and laugh, which is gonna think about it so goddamn much to this. People know that we're going to camp on a mountain. Did they know that?

Unknown 1:02:54
I won't do it.

Unknown 1:02:55
Yeah. And you know that behind the scenes like they, they had to sleep and talk about that, like, what's happening?

Unknown 1:03:01
sign off on all of that,

Unknown 1:03:02
right? The producers behind the scenes, they must do so. So well to explain people like you're not in danger, just saying this moment a little longer. And I think I think what he does to like approach businesses. I think what the show does is they sell it as reality TV. Mm hmm. And that gets people to sign on.

Unknown 1:03:20
Yeah, yeah. Which if you think about it, I don't know. Like, once you have agreed to a reality TV show, I think it's kind of an agreed, like,

Unknown 1:03:31
Yeah, I know they don't over explain the show when they're trying to get into when they're trying to like do a do an episode somewhere they like they don't explain it's a comedy show.

Unknown 1:03:40
Yeah, that's for sure. They just like you just know, like, Oh, it's like if you if you've never been on a reality TV show, like you don't know what's going to happen. You don't know what goes on behind the scenes. And I think that's like part of the magic is, you know, they don't know what they're signing up for necessarily, but they know it is a thing. So I never thought it was me. Most of the time I was distracted by the logistics and like I just had a logistical Boehner the whole time. It's like, Oh my god, how are they pulling this off? Like how were they had to

Unknown 1:04:10
go build that room and make a tiny little door? Or they had to find a way to get that antique shop? And like that's one of my favorite antique shop. It kills me that poor guy in the house

Unknown 1:04:21
when he breaks the plane on his way out.

Unknown 1:04:25
Response totally strangers like what do you want the pizza?

Unknown 1:04:30
Man I it gets Alex I know what you mean. Like it makes there's a couple times where I've watched watch the show with Max and we like or like oh my god, I can watch my wife just as she's just like, I cannot watch this. This is just oh yeah, I can't watch it. I watch it with my husband. I can't watch it by myself because it makes me to cringe. But if I have someone to share in the horror and craziness then I can somehow do it. And we there's a couple of bits. He's done that like Max and I were like, oh, that ran pretty close to what to what we like to do at cards. And we're Oh yeah. I'm like whoa, boy, how much kind of comedy we're chasing. But my favorite. Yeah, my favorite my favorite moments in the show are the stuff just like Nathan just doing stuff like when he's when he's doing the the daddy's watching rhyme and the girl calls him the attractive woman calls in Nate and he's like, it's Nathan. Needs fine. Either way, it's

Unknown 1:05:22
it's casual. And with the way they build up over so much time build up so much footage of him being awkward with people in general and women in particular, even animals to where they are able to do a montage of him being awkward with women.

Unknown 1:05:36
I mean, even dogs like even when he tries to pet a dog like dog like,

Unknown 1:05:40
every time he walks into a room to greet someone, there's always a just a video of him and he walks in and he he does this odd bow when he extends his hand he This is really isn't about a sense of like being it just doesn't seem to know how to interact physically with another person. And it's it's just, it's so awesome. there's any way to understand for those of you that are not going to watch the whatever four episodes four seasons of this show the basic premises there's usually two of these per half hour ish episode. In some cases, and I've said before, the one I would recommend personally the gateway episode as it's increasingly being called. My favorite is gas station slash caricature artist and the way they're, you know, slightly interleaved with each other. But yeah, the basic premise is that he goes in and he fixes your business for you with the most terrible like beyond you look nice today. worst idea ever for a business. Like for the first episode begins with him telling this guy that his frozen yogurt shop would be more successful if they had a poop flavor. That's that's the first. So that's that's the context.

Unknown 1:06:42
Do you think this show was designed as is or it? Absolutely evolved? Like I know this sounds like a leading question. But the first couple like the first season is like, Hey, I thought it was fine. Really?

Unknown 1:06:59
You didn't like yesterday?

Unknown 1:07:00
I did. Like that was the one that one and the Santa. I think it just gets better and better. Yeah. And I wonder if they realize like, oh, the bad business isn't funny. It's the implementation of it. Because before they didn't

Unknown 1:07:14
when was when was the smokers welcome episode.

Unknown 1:07:18
Oh, that was the force part forces. 34 Yeah, it was it was towards the end

Unknown 1:07:22
cuz I really not the second but I need to talk about that episode. There's, it's like, it's like, it's like a reading. It's like a bore a story. Like what they pull off in that episode is so goddamn bananas.

Unknown 1:07:33
Well, I think that's why the later seasons are better. Because if they do show real or not the logistics that go into it, even if the idea is like, you know, like a theory, the smoking one. I'm like, you know, I would not have that. not half bad, but then the implementation of it, but he's

Unknown 1:07:52
halfway cool. Can we spoil? spoil this episode for people? Yeah,

Unknown 1:07:54
all spoilers for Nathan for you. It

Unknown 1:07:58
can be spoiled. It's nice to good. Yeah, no, no, it's all inputs, pure implementation. So basically, Nathan has decided apparently by forgot that the 1881 Club. It's this bar in Pasadena, where he basically gets footage of the woman who runs the bar owns the bar saying yeah, we've lost a lot of business since people can't smoke it here. It's a flimsiest of concepts ever. But his bit is okay, we need to find a way for you to be able to have smoking be allowed in this bar again, starts out real simple. And so he finds some bullet point in California law that says smoking indoors is legal if it's part of a, a substantial part of a theatrical productions. So he's decided long story short, and this is this is the first half of the show is this hilarious bit where he goes, Okay, so what we're gonna do is we're going to get to theater seats and a curtain and put them in the corner. And we're going to tell people we're going to it is a play, it's a play called smokers allowed a theatrical production. And that's the sign that he hangs underneath the bar sign smokers allowed. And so he thought he somehow corrals these two women to come and watch the play. And it's it is a genuinely funny, like, very meta, very postmodern bit where a curtain opens, and it's just a bunch of people in a bar drinking and smoking. And that's the play, and it's fun. It's really, it's very, very funny. But man, this one made me so uncomfortable. But then it really blooms because Nathan has realized and pitches to the bar owner, maybe this place would be more successful if it was put on a real play. That was the night of activity that just happened. So Nathan gets all the camera footage pours over it hires transcriptionist to write that it's like boys basically gets it or likes Nikki, New York and gets it creates a binder six inches thick of this script of everything everybody says.

Unknown 1:09:54
Yes,

Unknown 1:09:54
yes, he casts it with the with this is the pink haired woman episode. Yes. Yes, man. He went on Twitter and talked about it, by the way. Well, I'll bring that up later. Go ahead.

Unknown 1:10:03
Yeah, in a good way. Anyhow, it's I just this this one really got me thinking about because the whole point of this movie, as we say, in college for grounds, the idea that they're having fun with your expectations and reality. They're having a lot of fun with that in this episode, where eventually now they've installed seven theater seats. And you can go in and they show side by side. So they've done three days of rehearsals. They put it there so good with bad fake beards on this show. There's but everybody's everybody's enacting everything that happened that one night as a play. Just a night in a bar. Yeah, yeah. And the guy showed off a skateboard deck. But that has to happen right at the moment that the three people at the bar taking the selfie. And like there's this actual tension, where you're like rooting along for this fake play about a fake incident? In a fake reality show. And put you're totally invested in it. When it's fake all the way down to me.

Unknown 1:11:00
Yeah, you put it best. Yeah.

Unknown 1:11:05
That's the first season right? third or fourth? Yeah. And the first season there's a leans a little more heavily on Nathan's loneliness. And at the end of the episode co SS, the client.

Unknown 1:11:17
The private detectives are the private

Unknown 1:11:19
investors. They suddenly are kind of like,

Unknown 1:11:22
No, I don't think so at one time. One time he's hired a private investigator to find out if somebody find out was it I forget the initial reason but then the private investigator doesn't want to hang out with him the private investigator the pistol so he hires another private investigator to find out if the private investigators excuse for why couldn't hang out. And then that private investigator doesn't want to hang out with him either. Oh my

Unknown 1:11:48
god, and then is that the episode there's also an episode where he wants to find out if he's a fun person. So he takes he takes the person's PNES analyze to see if there's any other feel good chemicals like serotonin or anything. Like I just want you to know that you did have fun with me. And I analyzed.

Unknown 1:12:11
This moving company has high labor costs, so he decides to turn it into a fake workout where people will come so real. So the poor guy. Yeah, I've never been to a gym and that we're facial hair. And so anyway, and that, of course has to bring the private investigator back in for that to find out whether the spokesman has been using the gym equipment inside of the tiny storage shed that he got him. Anyway,

Unknown 1:12:37
we should make clear that this is the same private detective that he uses throughout the entire series. The show

Unknown 1:12:44
you got the private investigator, you got the judge, you've got the guy who does photo.

Unknown 1:12:53
Aging people in photos and he has no idea what he's doing. He's just using Photoshop and making people

Unknown 1:13:01
the gender of the kid wrong.

Unknown 1:13:04
That's the boy

Unknown 1:13:07
Okay, so I'm just being Chris Farley, but it's it's a show about messing with your idea of reality in some ways. Which brings you up to the finale.

Unknown 1:13:15
Oh, wow. This is like there's so many

Unknown 1:13:17
layers. There's so many layers to this episode. It's Kevin. Kevin. You didn't get a chance to watch this very very, very long episode did not It's okay. Did you still get you'll still get paid?
