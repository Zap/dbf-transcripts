But you know, for the show john Roderick doesn't listen the show fuck him. He You know, he has this idea that he would like to take to Cheney and put him in an underground bunker and then put LSD into his food and then slowly move the furniture at night. Like a classic Deep State Gaslight.

So you guys thinking about anything other than Jeffrey Epstein for the last two weeks.

Unknown 4:30
I learned about this woman who sells her bathwater.

Unknown 4:32
Oh yeah, I didn't remember that.

Unknown 4:36
Should I get into the whole backstory? I forgot that. But that was so long ago already.

Unknown 4:40
Well, okay, listen for for our listeners. Let's just say that max

Unknown 4:45
expressed an interest in the scholarship of learning about the bathwater gamer lady in the main episode that continued in earnest through the after show and hope I'm not speaking out of school. In the scholarship continued in in earnest in our super secret private text channel. way past the point. I was literally begging you to please stop talking about the income anime hornik face.

Unknown 5:12
I completely figured it out. Can I give Mike I give the my whole thesis here. Yes, please. So basically, Okay, so here's the story of the gamer bath water cup. I'm sure some of our listeners are already that are already laughing that we don't know if

Unknown 5:24
you did talk about it last week.

Unknown 5:26
No, I know. But, but I think ever. I think she's a pretty well known she's more of a well known figure than I initially thought. Like, like, okay, so part of why people were buying the best daughter

Unknown 5:36
story had gone wider than you thought.

Unknown 5:39
Yeah, but not just because of this. Like she was already a morning Instagram poster with a big following, which is why people were buying the bath water. Well, yeah, yes. Okay. Well, I didn't know that was it? I didn't know that. Now. I know that okay, but she became famous for doing it. So when you watch anime, but the kind of anime where they have sex where it's horny, they make a horny face. And she became famous on Instagram for making the horny anime face but in real life like he she can actually do it with her face. It looks like it's like the from I think you should leave where He's choking, but he can't admit it.

Unknown 6:14
Okay, I'm looking anime horny face on. Oh, no. Yeah, okay. Oh, and they often have something dripping out of their mouth. Oh, is that where the egg comes from? I have to assume it's all of a piece. Their mouths are so moist. All these women

Unknown 6:27
she became famous for making the horny face and developed a fan following of people who their special thing is seeing the horny face. And then she's done a variety and and per my initial suspicion. She's now become almost like a like a horny performance artist. And she does. She did a thing where she said if you give me this many likes, I'll post on porn hub. But then the thing she posted on porn hub was like completely mundane. It was her

Unknown 6:55
eating a photo.

Unknown 6:57
photo. We talked about this last. Now okay, but

Unknown 7:02
Okay, well, now I know. And so the bath water is just the latest in a string of these things. And her audience of fans. Let's just say they're not there for the contemporary art. Well,

Unknown 7:18
when you when you catch up with Roderick on the line, you will have heard a discussion about this

Unknown 7:22
is this most recently and

Unknown 7:24
Oh God, you guys somehow. I don't know how it leaked out. But it got to john and i find this whole thing upsetting. And so of course, he interrogated me about it. And that became the entire episode. Oh, well, well, and he tells the story of the time that he dated an internet sex worker.

Unknown 7:42
Oh, okay. Yes. Yeah, so it wasn't like a mutual massage friend. It was an actual internet sex or Oh, I'm so excited. You know, don't tell me I'm missing.

Unknown 7:52
Yeah, yeah. Oh, wow. Sorry. I don't like to promote

Unknown 7:55
what is the game XF water girl sex worker are we are we is that

Unknown 7:58
it depends on how you would define sex work. Some people define cam girls is it

Unknown 8:03
started out? Yes. Well, but the problem is the backlash to the backlash to the backlash. backlash. Okay, no, you know, this is this is you're stealing our Japanese culture. No, actually, I'm actually Japanese. And I think this is really cool. Oh, yeah. Well, this is a pro sex worker. You know what you guys she's not a real sex worker that that the ping pong ping pong just goes back and forth, but not literally ping pong. But it does go back and forth about all the backlash to the backlash to the backlash. Don't don't don't disempower the egg calm lady.

Unknown 8:32
I know I know she's she's just

Unknown 8:34
she's just spitting out what's left of a revenue stream. And bottling it I know I know

Unknown 8:40
lots of people who post whose main source of revenue is posting photos of themselves on Instagram and I but I will describe them as sex workers.

Unknown 8:48
Do they post it with the attend in tent for people to masturbate?

Unknown 8:54
I don't know.

Unknown 8:55
That's See that's it.

Unknown 8:58
We are you are you are you kidding? Are you not? I'm in a real time

Unknown 9:02
fucking Kafka novel everything I do for the rest of my life is going to be people making me uncomfortable. I do not wait I do know the answer. No,

Unknown 9:09
they don't but they're doing the same thing workers do you think that's why she's doing the Okay, wait a minute. breaks.

Unknown 9:18
Breaks Chomsky? I would the fuck you're saying it's it's only sex work if they think men are going to masturbate to it?

Unknown 9:24
Are they getting any revenue from the men masturbating? And you could say like, Am I answering your question with a question? No. So you could you could say technically yes they are because they're if they're an influencer or something, they buy my product or they like pacing influencers don't masturbate, or they get money from a twitch stream or something.

Unknown 9:45
Victoria's Secret did not produce the 1984 the spring of 1984 calendar for me, right and yet I was able to utilize it.

Unknown 9:54
Yes, yes. Yes, sir. Those are models, I would say but they were not influencing

Unknown 10:00
a guy from Berlin.

Unknown 10:02
I can turn anything into anything and then make it very, very wet. You don't

Unknown 10:06
go to war with the army you have with the army. You want to go to war with the army you have

Unknown 10:10
you got to shoot to the side. Otherwise, it all sticks together.

Unknown 10:13
Go to the show notes for all of Alex's work links about sex work.

Unknown 10:18
How many people do you and I know where their careers that they're attractive? Women gamers post about games on Instagram? Was it but where they're always like leaning over the board in a provocative way? And it's like, what is that? Are you are you a game? Because they wouldn't describe themselves as a sex worker. I think they tend to take great offense at that. I think they would say no, I'm Look, I'm a nerd. And I'm a game evangelist. And I'm posting about games for my audience of gamers.

Unknown 10:40
Okay, what about a TV weather lady?

Unknown 10:43
Well, that's well, that's the thing though, they are also using their assets, but they're not like, it's a fine, fine line. Like if you're going to I'm trying to think of Oh, if you're if you're wearing a like if you're virtue signaling with the mega group, Make America Great Again, hat like you're going to get more money on Twitch. If you're showing off your boobs, you're probably going to get more money on Twitch depending on what your audiences and I think we have smart friends who intentionally do that, and like lean into it, and it's a community of folks who talked to each other.

Unknown 11:18
So just be clear, I'm not anti this or shaming it or anything. I'm just acknowledging that that's a component of its marketing, right?

Unknown 11:26
Yes. There's a difference between using sex as marketing and being a sex worker like if you're what's the

Unknown 11:33
difference though? Because that's the part that that's what I'm interested in.

Unknown 11:36
Um, if you are an influencer and you're driving around a cool car and showing off the car, that doesn't mean you're a professional racer, or you're a professional car person. You're just using that card to look cool. Let's say you own a boat. And do you are like look at this cool yacht I'm on that doesn't mean you're a person but why are you making this arbitrary distinction of like exactly

Unknown 11:59
a if it's if it's for Dave it makes dudes horny then it's sex work but other because like what if your car but what if the Jerry Seinfeld comedians a car,

Unknown 12:08
car car buyers horny their morning for cars? Well, but I don't think it's all about intent. And whether that person says they're a sex worker, not every

Unknown 12:17
one of Top Chef makes me horny for food

Unknown 12:19
XL

Unknown 12:24
sophomore year, it's 9am. And I'm dropping this class so far.

Unknown 12:28
I remember the day where it was it was I was like a freshman in college. And we posted some It was early days of Facebook. And we posted a like a selfie on Facebook and two of my friends were like, oh, man, I wonder how many people are going to masturbate to this photo? And my mind just exploded like of course like there there's there's like four girls with pajamas in here and like of course of course so and that I

Unknown 12:57
one time one time

Unknown 13:01
flicker my pal Katie I don't know if it hasn't been somebody took a photo of her like sitting in the backseat of the car. And she's like, She's so cute girl she's but she's like a talented girl. But she's a cute girl and took a photo of her in the backseat of the car. And this this mystery era where you know, on flicker, you could add things to groups like you can have your own like sort of albums of things. And like this is this is how naive those times were. People just didn't do super weird stuff on Flickr that was very, that I didn't see it. Anyhow, you know, it was really you know, it's a fun social network. But she discovered that she'd been added to this group or to this whatever call collection album. Oh, well, there were two there were two interesting things about it. The one is it was all pictures of like pretty cute young girls in the seat of a car wearing a seatbelt and every single single one of those photos had a comment like almost exactly the same comment which is like it's good that you're being secure Make sure to put on the seat belt

Unknown 13:58
now that make Katie a sex worker

Unknown 14:04
it's almost like sex that because there's no one she's not profiting for that

Unknown 14:09
middle me this dairy da Is she a sex

Unknown 14:11

Unknown 14:47

Unknown 15:24

Unknown 15:40
How would this bubble I'm curious how the bubble smock would work. Merlin. I'm hung up on this. It's a it's a great question.

Unknown 15:46
That's why like Tony Stark's plane and Spider Man where it's got the hokey technology and the baby suit areas.

Unknown 15:53
I mean, I think it would still have to be it would still have to be very humble. Right? You eat meat. You get it you you get a Mormon.

Unknown 16:03
Sexy, smocks.

Unknown 16:04
No, no, no, no, no, not one of those little ones just to

Unknown 16:08
see roughly her shape. That's the whole point. The whole point is she's smoking you bubble on smock.

Unknown 16:15
Like oh, man.

Unknown 16:16
Well, and you could do with a RO wait hang on AR AP AR app that bubbles ladies and smokes. Walking around whatever Mormons use for a mall and not getting a hand job you save $6 but you got your goggles on and all around you you can see things like oh, this is six feet long. This is a flat plane bubbles on

Unknown 16:36
smock yeah used to walk up to women and like surreptitiously put like an AR sticker on their

Unknown 16:43
NFC NFC nipple stickers Okay, let's go with that.

Unknown 16:48
Hey Siri, activate bubbles.

Unknown 16:51
nipple field controller

Unknown 16:54
I love you

Unknown 16:57
Oh boy.

Unknown 17:00
This what happens when I take the wheels off of Max's

Unknown 17:04
I'm off my game

Unknown 17:09
sex worker or not sex worker or not?

Unknown 17:16
a sex worker or a sandwich

Unknown 17:17
there was there was actually discussion about whether or not a lot of reality TV show stars are sex workers because you know that those the women on survivor Let me ask you about this.

Unknown 17:31
Okay, let me ask you about that in particular, how much of survivor Oh, let me ask you this. How much of of what the general public watches survivor for is women in in in swimsuits?

Unknown 17:43
Exactly. I don't

Unknown 17:45
probably have an answer. Well, it's the it's the swimsuits and it's the slips and it's the tortured feet there is something for some slice of the pie you know there's some tortured feat boys there. Oh, wow.

Unknown 17:57
Yeah, stop on their clam step on it.

Unknown 18:00
Really this is really more mental than physical. Click it don't eat the egg and spit it out in the comment and may hornik but she's not she's a feeder. So

Unknown 18:11
I when I was doing my job my survivor draft I looked at you know they get dressed by like a wardrobe depart Yeah,

Unknown 18:17
you chose by UD choose my swimsuit. In some cases

Unknown 18:20
I did. So I what I what So basically, what happens is, I think you bring a suitcase of your own clothes, and then the production team like, goes through your clothes and they give you some outfits to wear. And the idea is that they're not trying to make it fake, but they're trying to make it like okay, the plane crashed and this is the outfit that you would be wearing per year background and career. So if you're like a lawyer, you don't get to show up to survivor dressed in like a bunch of fucking tactical ass survivor gear. Like,

Unknown 18:45
I mean, Nick is a great example of that, like that was Nick wearing like a sport coat the whole time. But

Unknown 18:49
that's the thing. It's awesome though.

Unknown 18:51
It's because the production designers decided that the best way to carry out the fiction of survivor was to say Nick's background is that he's this young vendor Ed. Yeah, exactly. And if he was on the plane and the plane crash like this is what he would have and so they give you all Bob would use his buffets a bow tie. Yeah. And so they give you a few different options like per your your character, and you wear those and so I did I went into the like the preview the next season on survivor clips and Entertainment Weekly had some like little exclusives, you know, and stuff. And I looked really carefully to see which of the women got dressed in a two piece bathing suit. And I thought because you get points in my draft league for how much screen time and how many confessionals they get. And I thought the cameras they're going to be on camera more like they just are. I was written as right. Yep, yep. I actually took Victoria the redhead from last season. Oh, I took her because for two reasons. Number one, I thought she was very funny and interviews and I thought funny. People will get more confessionals and they put her in a two piece bathing suit. And I bet I said I bet she's gonna get I bet that indicates that she's going to get a lot of camera time. And I was right on both counts.

Unknown 19:57
This is absolutely disgusting. And I'm very much about it. But there are rumors that because Aubrey had like lost weight or apparently got hotter or something they gave her a different suit and CBS you can like show a butt crack. But you know, I don't like oh, this is surprised, you

Unknown 20:18
know, I mean, I can't figure out I can't figure out anything about how your mind works.

Unknown 20:21
I'm upset. I am upset I am upset

Unknown 20:25
that she wasn't paid enough.

Unknown 20:26
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no you're not you're not paid for more screen time unless you get your final know for but if you are in the like you're in the season longer, right? Yes, that's Yes. Now and well. They're like you're saying

Unknown 20:44
because they're they're tired Alex you're saying they had a meeting they had the whole staff gets together and they're holding up a bunch of glossy photos and they're like did Aubrey cross the threshold of the two piece is she cross line piece Rubicon piece worthy What?

Unknown 20:57
You don't think that the costume designers in aren't doing like Okay, so this guy is gonna look dumb in like you think those little like weird pink panties for Philip wasn't completely staged by I'm sure he was like Mr. briefs and then they're like okay how do we make him look as my my

Unknown 21:16
understanding is that you bring a suitcase on the show have your own things and they dress you from that they decide what you could take with you but those the brought the little the little blue shirt

Unknown 21:28
you need to tell them in advance though. And sometimes when they're the

Unknown 21:32
one in advance the

Unknown 21:34
you tell them this is what I'm bringing and they're like, okay, you can do that. But change it to this or change it to this

Unknown 21:39
are so busy. How do you find this out? Sir? I read. I read a

Unknown 21:45
book. Yeah, I think

Unknown 21:45
I might have asked my close personal friend Jeff probs. I said, Jeff, how do you dress?

Unknown 21:49
You find a way to eat your fruit by?

Unknown 21:51
I haven't broached the subject. Yeah,

Unknown 21:53
it doesn't feel like it has to come up at some point. It's kind of a Larry David things just hanging on. Jeff. Do you just not like for boy who doesn't like a fruit pie?

Unknown 22:02
I think we can get you I think Jeff has gettable for us.

Unknown 22:04
He seems like a nice guy. Merlin. I know you don't like guests, but I couldn't.

Unknown 22:08
I don't like pests. guests. Well, both, I assume.

Unknown 22:11
Oh, good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Yes. Yes. No, that's that's fine. I guess cuz he's a snack. My daughter just started jumping into season two. He looks so young. Yeah.

Unknown 22:21
Here's something Do you think that there was like some magical thing that happened where he he's young. He's young. He's young. And then he doesn't look old. But he looks like he has matured? And then he sort of stays that way. Yeah. And it's very strange. Like I'm sure it's like plastic surgery or like that's which is totally fine. Jeff keeping a snack.

Unknown 22:42
I think Jeff has an entire team of people around him and they have they have the briefcase full of creams and vials. And they got a powder man. I think he's got a whole squad.

Unknown 22:55
He's got somebody who's got the football and the magnifying glass. Yeah. And they come up with any of the pills. The powder. Yeah,

Unknown 23:00
he's got he's got a whole little team of mini me's who run behind them with the briefcase. And they've got they've got powders and injections and all different creams and masks and their job is to keep Jeff on the right side of the two piece bathing suit line.

Unknown 23:15
Oh, oh, god forbid. I see what you're saying. Oh boy, hosted by his own. I don't know.

Unknown 23:24
I think there's a team of people who scurry behind Jeff bringing him his healthy green balls and his lip injections and his moisturizing cream. His secret moisturizing creams that are made from the is a lot of green drinks. I think he's doing the adrenal Chrome. I think that I think that they're all doing the adrenal you think

Unknown 23:40
he's mom's up with the adrenal chrome people?

Unknown 23:42
Well, that's what the why the rich people need to harvest the young girls is that they take

Unknown 23:48
girls putting their brains good to get the good shit. They have to die terrified. Is that correct?

Unknown 23:53
Oh, I can't hurt

Unknown 23:55
No, no, I think that's

Unknown 23:57
according to the 17th letter of the about people. You are the adrenal Crone is is harvested from young girls. And this is why Hillary Clinton is killing young women. But to get the good adrenal chrome they have to be terrified as a being

Unknown 24:12
and it's like it's like the blue crab shit right there taking the blue crab blood from know

Unknown 24:16
what that's worth. Any idea what that's worth?

Unknown 25:34
the hot the other Hollywood guy. The Harvey Weinstein, he

Unknown 25:38
actually he actually really did hire the ex Mossad people to go after his accuser. Like he was like, he actually literally did that. And I think FC might have worked with that same firm at some point. Yeah,

I know, people who are like running people off the road and saying to there's, there's this, I think English woman who's done a couple really good interviews in the last week, she'd written a vanity fair article, where, according to her Graydon Carter pulled out all the kids stuff, and it turned into essentially a puff piece. And so she's done suit to Super interest, she was pregnant with twins at the time, and her editor gave her this assignment that, you know, she thought would be a doddle for her, which is to just do this Jeffrey Epstein thing, but she kept finding more and more and more and more stuff. And he he directly threatened her and like I I'm trying, I don't want to mistake the facts. But it was along the lines of like, I know, the hospital your kids are going to be born in like, it's pretty it gets. There's all the dark stuff we know about but then there's this other dark stuff that's like, Oh, my God, you don't do you know, it's like what these guys these guys don't do one bad thing. They don't do six bad things. Like they've built up this entire life of these all these tangled systems and deliberate corruption that allow them to conduct themselves. And then their lawyers have to actually literally, I mean, I can't tell him what you guys are fighting or not. But like we're there, whether a lawyer can then come up and say his lawyer can say, Well, the reason that he has an Austrian passport that's not in his name. With his photo on it is because in as a very prominent and affluent Jewish man, there was a spate of kidnappings in the 80s. And he needed a way to have a passport that he could show the kidnappers to say that I'm not an affluent Jewish man.

Unknown 27:21
Oh my god

Unknown 27:23
that was in that was in the safe with the diamonds, and $70,000 in cash. And so you ask yourself for a man who has at least $500 million Do you think he has one safe with the password? diamonds and $70,000 70,000 that's walking around money? That's what you tip the other? Yeah. Oh, geez. I'm sorry. I dropped this into the Kevin channel. That's very confusing to him, huh? Yeah. In here instead. I'm bad at this.

Unknown 27:50
I I don't think I've thought about anything other than Jeffrey Epstein and magic tricks for the last two weeks. Oh, what a good combo. All I think about Yeah. How was everyone? Like, I'm honestly amazed that everyone isn't going around. Like I have this feeling of action something different now.

Unknown 28:10
I all I can think about a child prison still. So it's like my bro, you guys.

Unknown 28:17
Get with it that the hot the hotness this week, is that we really tore the party apart for an entire day to have a statement that we don't like with Donald Trump says, Oh, my Did you guys see the paperwork? It was such good paperwork. Did you see it? Yeah.

Unknown 28:36
Oh, my God wants to say on behalf of the host of Dubai Friday, we want to take a moment to condemn the President's reprehensible marks. And you know, what, what unites Americans really is our differences. And I think that we're a country of immigrants.

Unknown 28:50
In short, really, the Democratic Party is a land of contrast. Yeah.

Unknown 28:53
And in conclusion, somebody should do something. Oh, my God, I'm

Unknown 28:57
so glad somebody finally said that. Not us. Not me. No, no,

Unknown 29:02
no, never. Yeah, we know, we wouldn't be doing anything. But I mean, if we do our jobs, they'll take away our job.

Unknown 29:07
Yeah. Jesus fucking Christ.

Unknown 29:14
I can't believe I made her my wallpaper.

Unknown 29:16
I was a joke. The first time I saw

Unknown 29:25
that fucking, as soon as I saw that, I'm like, Oh, fuck Nancy Pelosi. And then it became like,

Unknown 29:32
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Nancy Pelosi is on your phone. But now, one of the beta?

Unknown 29:43
I think there's something to I think the reality is that the country is like, teetering on the brink of a constitutional crisis that we really have not had. We don't technically have one yet. But I guess so. But we're definitely

Unknown 29:57
I mean, just to your point, like, we haven't gotten to the point of how do we make the president leave the White House for a trial? For example. My dad is a dad would

Unknown 30:07
let me give you a concrete example of like, this census question could have gone and it could have gone to director we had a full on, you know, banana republic constitutional crisis where the Supreme Court said you can't do the question. And the way the supreme

Unknown 30:19
court if if and when there is a constant request, it's going to be about something involving the supreme court or the Marshal. What's his name? The Marshal the vice principal, man?

Unknown 30:28
I don't know. But, but, but like, that could have gone a very different way where like the Trump administration, you know, they tried to switch to the lawyers that would actually make it happen. And then the court said you can't change the lawyers like it was it was averted because there's like still some like institutional ism and whatever in the in the legal profession, and they like couldn't do it. But like, some, like listen, like it could happen any day, right? Like where the Supreme Court says, Don't do this. And then the Trump administration's like, now we're going to do it, that it actually has happened before in American history, but not living memory. And it could it could happen at any moment. And I think there's this idea that well, the democrats have the house and they could do something about it if and when that happens, but the problem is like it won't work because they don't have the Senate and and and so it's a real there's this this this Tinkerbell like quality to it. Of if the Pelosi and the democrats try to use their power, it will be exposed as not being power, and it will all collapse into into dust. Right? We'll all stop believing and Tinkerbell. And I and and so their conclusion based on that as well. We shouldn't even try because we don't want to be exposed as being powerless. So therefore, we won't even try to exercise that. That's super interesting.

Unknown 31:39
You know what I mean? It's like that night. I never thought of it that way. I mean, it's one of those things where you could walk around that point, you know, 40 different directions, but you've put it very, in a very straightforward way.

Unknown 31:50
It's like if we try this we will be exposed as it will be exposed as hollow and so we won't ever try it. Well, I mean, because OK, so the the thing I

Unknown 32:00
I've been thinking and trying to be supportive of is like, kindness is such a Trump Trump Aight, way to think but like, I figure people in leadership positions in the house in the Senate, know, stuff that I don't know. Now in the past, that kind of thing has been like, Oh, that's why we go to Iraq. That kind of bullshit like oh, transparencies for suckers. They know secret things because they get to go to the secret documents room and they know things. I don't know. I always figure they know, you look at how one way McConnell has succeeded so well is he's so good at not letting anything get to the floor that he doesn't know for sure is going to win. So you know what I mean, he has 100% comp, confidence up to the second he says, we've moved the vote to tomorrow, right? Is that fair to say? Like, McConnell's been good at that he's really good at like, whipping the votes that he needs. And and you won't know that he doesn't have the votes. He will not say he he'll never say he doesn't have the votes. And so you know, you can get it at the moment at 315 on Thursday, when he says, well, we're moving this to Monday. Right? And so I always just figure that the Democratic leadership historically, I believe they probably know stuff. I don't know. I don't know. There's the level of timidity we're talking about here makes me think that your theory is closer to the truth. that in order for them to be able to have what they I want to believe that everybody has a good heart. I want to believe that everybody has motivations, but like, just because I don't understand their motivations doesn't mean I'm going to assume they have bad or nefarious motivations. But sometimes it's just really hard to square. It's real hard to square. There's a lot of shit you guys can do that is short of impeachment, you know,

Unknown 33:32
right. But also like, well, I don't understand this, because like, just to look at the if we could take a step back from all of the theoretical hand wringing and what if this or that happens, like, the republicans impeach Clinton, right, and it was on so they knew it wouldn't be successful, but they did it anyway. And it led to them having one of like, like huge electorial success I mean, that like that there was there was up and downs in the moment. But but like long term, it led to them having huge electoral success. And then obviously, McConnell's whole playbook is he, I mean, they never had a they never had a way to impeach Obama. But they would have if they had even a slamming, they tried, they almost tried to over Benghazi, but like, which is like bullshit, but like, you know, that, you know, they would have tried if they could have but like, they, their their whole, like publicly stated mandate was we're not going to let Obama do anything. They were just going to be obstructionist and our goal is to end his presidency that the I think McConnell said that explicitly, like my top legislative goal is to like not give Obama a second term I think he said that publicly

Unknown 34:38
until like and to do everything everything in their power to like everything that's going to require anything related to the Senate is going to look obstructed every corner to make make him a lame duck.

Unknown 34:49
And look at where they are now like like you don't I mean like they did fuck with Obama at for eight years and look they're fired up their base and their base shut up to vote and here we are,

Unknown 34:58
I mean both likely say like, like Travis McIlroy likes to say ships are safest in harbor but that's not what we build ships exact and it's like that you know, I that's a silly I read that one time when I was peeing and hippies bathroom but it's really true. And that's why it's so frustrating to look at like Congress has been down in the count for so long. Oh, sure. We can go and laugh and Oh gosh, the all the Trump's agenda stuff you guys didn't get done when you had a boy Are you stupid everybody hates paul ryan fine. But now like would they do have a majority in Congress and their stuff they can do that does not require the Senate. They are the section one branch of government that does shit. It's your whole fucking job. Like, you know, the guy at Parkland got in trouble because he didn't help you know, because he was a security guard and that was his job and like we need them to be the security guards because that's their fucking job.

Unknown 35:44
It's like I always say you know, my private plane was built to for me to get massages from Andre Shawn

Unknown 35:50
just a massage and access just

Unknown 35:52
and it's safest and harbor but that's not why the plane was built.

Unknown 36:11
I think it's time for our challenge.

Unknown 36:13
Yeah.

Unknown 36:16
Oh my god, I have so many good

Unknown 36:17
things we can post this episode get started over

Unknown 36:21
to my challenge. challenge comes from Max and it involves nuts.

Unknown 36:26
Nuts max a week shy? I have a new service that I've been enjoying. What's it called Max? It's called nuts calm. And Veronica for full disclosure. This is Veronica service. She found it because they do they're very they have a really really really really good selection of sort of like interesting and alternative flowers like you know not flowers and things like that. And yeah, so we've been doing a lot of nuts com orders for for various snacks and baking products and I initially I made fun of it she had this like grocery list of all the crazy shit you going to get another comment I started writing fake things on there. Because I thought some of her stuff was fake that she written on there and I started adding things to it. And she was like, are these real things I'm not stuck on I was like no but neither are yours and neither is nuts common she's like no it's real. I'm getting all this stuff. And you know what Miss delusion You know what? I love it I love it. I get all my I get all my good treats from nuts calm.

Unknown 37:22
I'm surprised you've never heard of it was a sponsor of I don't know some show of Marco's years and years ago

Unknown 37:30
Why obviously I listened to Marco shows and I just he skips the Marco parts he gets all the parts about the keyboard just to get to the nuts

Unknown 37:36
yeah yeah and

Unknown 37:37
and listen you know chopper so I can find your know

Unknown 37:41
if there was a button in overcast that were if you press it it skip forward 30 seconds. I mean, I would not use that to skip the ads. I would listen I'm a file

Unknown 37:49
on a bug for years. Please add a nuts button.

Unknown 37:51
Yeah. Oh, okay. So you're saying there should be an ad in overcast where when you press it it does a dynamic ad insertion for nuts. com

Unknown 37:59
john Sir QCU before I met him, worked on the site for the public radio show car talk. And he added a boss button so he's the one who added a I believe

Unknown 38:08
he added Wait Wait, wait, wait, stop. Stop. Right there. Stop right there.

Unknown 38:13
He just wants to be remembered for one thing.

Unknown 38:19
He doesn't want to be remembered for the car top website or the boss bus

Unknown 38:21
stop right there. JOHN ZQ son made the website for car talk. I don't know what

Unknown 38:29
they are in Boston.

Unknown 38:30
Oh ok.

Unknown 38:33
Follow up did you make it in Pearl

Unknown 38:40
you can make anything and Berlin just won't be good.

Unknown 38:43
Swing he loves swing. Ah anyway a boss button back in the day. It wasn't just on the car talk site but different funny things would have what a boss button like like video games would have a boss button. You guys ever encounter this?

Unknown 38:56
Oh, I used to play the windows 95 Dilbert are Cade game, CD ROM. It was a free CD ROM that came with and what happens when you hit the boss button? It would make it look like it was like like a spreadsheet. a spreadsheet?

Unknown 39:08
Exactly. I'm saying we need a nuts button. I'm saying whatever bullshit podcast you're listening to you hit the Next button.

Unknown 39:16
You think is it possible that when I walk through the office, people are hitting the boss button that they're playing? Oh my god. Are they playing that the 1990 the windows 95 Dilbert arcade suite

Unknown 39:25
on the Gaslight now,

Unknown 39:26
and I walk by and then they hit and then they hit the boss button. Business business. Yeah. And it takes them to a spreadsheet.

Unknown 39:34
You should go go surprise go surprise. Jen right now like put on a fake mustache. sidle up to her maybe drop in Tom Cruise style.

Unknown 39:45
Haha. Let's see if I know Jen. If I know Jen. She probably would be working on a spreadsheet and then when I snuck up behind her she'd open up live journal.

Unknown 40:13
Okay, here's what's great about this. So we recorded because we needed to for reasons we ended up recording. I can remember specifically it was on a Friday. And Max had this cockamamie idea where he says to us he says he says I want to order something from nuts. com. I went to nuts calm. And for myself. I can talk about my order. But what I want to mention that well, secondarily, I love my order. But you know, blew my nuts off. I ordered on Friday afternoon and it arrived late Saturday morning. For 599 599 was the shipping to have my nuts delivered overnight.

Unknown 40:48
Veronica's theory is that they're doing expedited nuts orders for free because of the weather because like when it's summer you can't have them sitting outside.

Unknown 40:56
Oh, mine actually did come with a went to little frosty things.

Unknown 41:02
Boy, yeah, yeah. She talked about what we ordered. Yes, please. Would you get Max? What did you

Unknown 41:07
get? Oh, well, we the new thing that I'm the most excited about is a classic Lemon Drop candy. And this is like a real old lady candy. Oh yeah.

Unknown 41:16
The Football flavored ones with like citric acid powder. And I got a big old big old bag of lemon candies and I have a little plastic baggie them in my car and I get in the car Papa lemon candy and my mom.

Unknown 41:29
It's nice because you don't need a ton of those. You just want a couple of

Unknown 41:33
hundred and you put that in your mouth you put in your mouth and all citric acid powder dissolves in your tongue you feel your teeth now.

Unknown 41:38
Oh my god. There's so many max. There's also green apple drops and watermelon drops.

Unknown 41:41
You can just feel your teeth dissolving in your mouth. just turning into cook pasta in your mouth. I mean, it's just it's just

Unknown 41:51
put cheese on it. Yeah. Oh my god. What does that

Unknown 41:55
that's my that's probably the big winner. For Veronica. What the fuck did she get? You got something called like, snobs berries? Or? Or they can't be real. If she got some sort of thing that is like, Juju bees. She got some ggV that's I was like, that's not real. And it looks like eye candy. It looks like something from avatar.

Unknown 42:15
Oh, hold on. Hold on. Look up.

Unknown 42:19
Like old school.

Unknown 42:21
No, no, it's a fruit. It's a she kind of through real talk. Yes, that's what I'm saying.

Unknown 43:16

Unknown 43:29
Alex learned how to Alex I think Alex was an alien to observe our culture.

Unknown 43:45
leaves

Unknown 43:48
us trying very hard.

Unknown 43:53
I am greeting greeting you should we touch I

Unknown 43:56
didn't quite pay attention in there like alien alien briefing

Unknown 44:00
classes. She was distracted during the seminar.

Unknown 44:04
I like threw away the handbook.

Unknown 44:07
She's here and will every once in a while. I'll see her like go to the BBQ and take like a corn cob and put it in between two pieces of bread and eat a sandwich and eat it. Oh,

Unknown 44:18
it's corn cob sandwich. Boy.

Unknown 44:21
And I'm like, This isn't how you people eat food. Oh my god.

Unknown 44:25
I've liked your spoons. Now we are friends.

Unknown 44:31
So so we were a lot of us were at our friend's wedding this weekend. And I think I've talked about this when it is out of fancy occasion. I eat just normal food like everybody else to not bring attention to it. However, I was sitting like with all of my friends eating normal food, incredibly happy about all the flavors going into there was a lot of flavor. There was so much flavor, and people were very

Unknown 44:58
like

Unknown 45:00
agreements. Oh, yes, yes, I'm making foul agreements. I didn't like the party. We're all smoking our, our marijuana that everyone has. Well, I don't want to scandalize anyone who smokes marijuana. But I didn't like that everyone smokes a little computer now What happened? Did the world pass me by? Everyone took out a computer and it was like the scene It was like it was like it was like an inglorious he was eating three and a half apart from it was like, it was like this was like the scene in Inglorious Basterds where one person takes out a vape. And then he takes out this huge thing. People were taking their fucking rigs out like you know, it was crazy.

Unknown 45:47
They were smoking a C three video. It was.

Unknown 45:51
Oh, no, Yo, Baker, Master Luke,

Unknown 45:53
and everyone just had everyone had something that was literally the size of a deck of cards like a crazy story. Much smaller than that.

Unknown 46:02
I don't want to smoke computer. What about just rolling it up like a cigarette?

Unknown 46:06
Just using an apple. That's

Unknown 46:07
impolite. There's a lot of smoke. It's just actually,

Unknown 46:12
as we were sitting in a cloud of weed smoke, you could smell it from a mile away.

Unknown 46:18
I think when the bride and groom come and join you it is socially acceptable. I'm not

Unknown 46:22
saying it wasn't

Unknown 46:24
smoking a jazz cigarette. Yes,

Unknown 46:26
but when you are but think about if all of us had those jazz cigarettes, it would just not be a good time. It would not be a good time. I

Unknown 46:34
don't like I don't like it. I don't like smoking. I don't know how much of the marijuana that I'm smoking.

Unknown 46:38
Yes. Wait, wait. That's but hold on. What you mean you don't know how much of it

Unknown 46:45
I don't know how much it is sometimes you take up on one one cloud of the of the computer you and I and I get the like warp effect like you're going to hyperspace jump from Star Wars.

Unknown 47:02
Yeah, I'm gonna call just the most premium nuts I've ever had. Right? What are you happy chef Phil Burt's the next handsome I'm sure I don't want to I don't want to interrupt your I want to compete one. I don't like eating coffee.

Unknown 47:12
Oh, it's it's so Merlin. I have

Unknown 47:14
I have a delicate system. It upsets my stomach

Unknown 47:16
it Oh, I can I wonder? Yeah, I just realized I'm probably gonna have a bad time later. Um, have you ever had espresso beans, Merlin covered in chocolate. I'm eating caffeinated.

Unknown 47:29
You gotta be careful with those. For me. It's iced coffee. I always forget I forget about iced coffee until we got to go to New England. And we'll go to dunkin donuts and I'll have a nice coffee and I'm just bouncing off the fucking walls. I'm like a medium iced coffee.

Unknown 47:42
There was a period in college I live kind of close to a trader joes. And we go to TJ and we get some food for the dorms. And I one time I discovered the chocolate covered espresso beans. And I basically just started eating those as food. Like that was what I was eating. And boy, that was not and then after a while I was like why I'm using Adderall is Siri I was like why do why do I have diarrhea? Always

Unknown 48:07
crazy.

Unknown 48:09
I actually go Hold like how many of these Can I eat? Assuming they were like edibles or something like it. I should start with just having one. And, and marco.org there's you know, a guide to chocolate covered espresso beans. And and apparently 30 is like a regular cup of coffee. And I'm like I'm not going to 30 pieces of candy. And oh, maybe I should I don't know.

Unknown 48:36
It's amazing to me that chill you to chocolate covered Express with me and I would describe that as a very, you know, flavor. It's a lot of flavor in a small package. It's like the caper of of candies.

Unknown 48:46
Here's the thing. I thought that I was getting caffeine from it, but I think I'm just getting a slight Sugar Rush because I usually don't have candy and he does a lot of sugar in it. And then I'm like, hey,

Unknown 48:57
Merlin, what was the best was the best thing you ordered?

Unknown 49:01
Oh, um, let's see. I mean in terms of like, I bought these nuts thinking cuz i do i like i like premium nuts and I'm a real size Queen about my nuts. I really like them to be like if it doesn't have macadamia is don't even bother I do my own bespoke mixes of three different blends of premium nuts and decant them myself. And these are way better than anything I've ever done. Um, so what I do is I'll take I'll take a, a can or jar of like really good premium nuts. I'll also take a can or jar of macadamia nuts, and I will take up but not a bunch, but enough pistachios. And it makes all of those together in a bowl. And then I put them into small containers and but this has all of that plus plus Brazil and filbert.

Unknown 49:46
Now are you when you eat the not mix? Are you having one nut at a time? Are you making multi nut combos in your mouth?

Unknown 49:51
No, I'm doing numerous multi nut combos easier than five minutes. Okay,

Unknown 49:55
I think that's really where you get the the the flavor the good flavor,

Unknown 49:58
and they're all different different textures different mouth feel.

Unknown 50:01
You know what I like is a little salted pumpkin seed. Yeah, that can be real good and and not

Unknown 50:07
bitter. It's sort of bitter and salty. Yeah, really good. And then

Unknown 50:10
you get that in the not Mexico now we're now we're like this
