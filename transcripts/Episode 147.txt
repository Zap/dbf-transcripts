This is due by Friday, a weekly challenge podcast with Berlin man, Alex Cox and Max temple. This week's challenge read married to the mouth. I have to say starting the show with just the two of us and knowing that max isn't going to show up yet takes away some of the magic like knowing or in by magic I mean cold sweats so it's it's good and bad.

Unknown 0:37
Well, let's explore this.

Unknown 0:39
It's no because the magic of the pre show I'm sure is me just anxiously wondering where the hell is Max but now we know Max is on the way.

I've had to ban myself from the foods I love. Oh, there's three thing I said this before. I just need to keep saying it because I got I've got to remember this. I mean, like KFC, Popeyes, and McDonald's are three things, three flavors of things that it looks looks like some of my favorite food in the world. But I've got to stop eating it full stop. Here's the thing Uber Eats. Uber Eats. I've discovered Uber Eats. Oh no. It's different from the other ones. Uber is very opt for it. Well, I'm sure it varies by place but where I am exactly like where I live and the proximity of there's not much fast food, you know, chain fast food. But there is a McDonalds about a mile from my place. And here's the thing I've checked. Uber Eats will get that hot to my door in like 20 minutes.

Unknown 2:30
That's why I said oh no, because Uber Eats is great.

Unknown 2:35
Alexandra, it's Sunday morning. I'm ordering while I'm in bed. The birdies are still walking, and I'm on the phone going. Yes, please. And thank you. I'll take three egg muffins and five hash browns because I know nobody ever wants something you may want McDonalds. No, nobody ever wants McDonald's until the McDonalds arrives. So I do a preemptive over order but then I eat them. And then I feel like shit all day I go to KFC they get a chicken sandwich. That makes me feel sick all day. I get a three piece spicy white meat from Popeye's makes me feel sick all day it has to end. Also I need to stop eating a pint of ice cream with a bunch of m&ms dumped into it that needs to NO because

Unknown 7:11
It seems like the volume has been turned up on that one. Well,

Unknown 7:14
she is officially a tween because she just walks around with earphones in listening to Taz. Every single I picked her up at school yesterday. We're getting to a point where like she'll hopefully be able to come home on her own. But you know, it's going to involve public transit and stuff. But yeah, the whole the whole Muni ride home. She's listening to this has I'm trying to talk to her like a person.

Unknown 7:35
No, no, no, no. Yeah, she's very exciting. Yeah, I'm sure you've talked about it. But what happens? Do you Well, let me word it this way.

Unknown 7:44
I'll say Escarra.

Unknown 7:47
If the question comes up of, Hey, Dad, I want to listen to one of your podcasts. What do you do? Right?

Unknown 7:55
Well, yes, as you can imagine, that's a non issue in my household.

Unknown 8:00
Are you sure? Are you sure?

Unknown 8:02
I don't I mean, you know, I am who I am. I'm like Popeye, you know? I don't know. I mean, you know, I have so much to worry about that I really have to adopt the view that I'll deal with it when it becomes You know, when you're spinning plates, you don't really have time to like do interviews. So you know when that one's about to crash to the floor, I'll run over the stick and try and keep it spinning. But no, I mean the I mean the thing is it's it evidences itself as and it's a little bit of a perfect storm right now because she's gotten very very like even further into like making stuff so she's very into like she's now into not just she's moved from painting miniatures to painting on canvases and then bigger canvases. Oh, you saw the way she did her phone case.

Unknown 8:51
Oh my god Holy shit. Yeah, easily pay $50 for that phone case and you've seen me on the internet like I'm at actually crazy.

Unknown 9:01
Why know she'd love to make one for you? Yeah, it's but she's she's she's extended that she's introduced Stephen the goldfish into the paintings. She's become like an outsider artist. She has a Stephen the goldfish pendant and she's made for herself. She and she so she does that she does all this this painting all this stuff. I don't think she'd mind me sharing. I mean, this one's This one's you know, some pretty basic nativist art. But Oh, damn, that's one of our recent canvases is lit up with taco.

Unknown 9:33
That's so cool.

Unknown 9:37
Oh, my God.

Unknown 9:42
She does definitely should get the hot glue gun out and she'll turn the painting from something you can hang on a wall. That's something you would put on a table and she's made a waterfall out of hot glue for it. And there's like a whole thing but her she is she's very much like an insane outsider artist, that some hipster New York would collect because she's making things that make no sense. But they do have themes. You know what I mean? Like you need good outsider artist has to have something about their background, their mental illness and what she's doing in and it's really the Taz stuff is being evidenced in a lot of her. Her young work. She's coming through taco period.

Unknown 10:15
She She doesn't have anything wrong enough with her yet.

Unknown 10:20
What we're running up against though, is you know, there's always the language thing. There's some thematic things that one worries about, you know, she knows she wants in Africa. Fuck you. Oh, she knows that's not something she can really have. And she's totally aware of that. And like, you know, she knows she wants a trace horny boys shirt. And she knows she can't have that. That's like yeah, it makes us look bad, you know? Yeah, but now we're shading into like she's now of course know. We watched the TV show over and over and over. And that's got some stuff in it. But now we're getting we're bumping up against the Ben Ben Pran. And so she will watch a YouTube video that's just a compilation of final Yahoo's. She will watch obviously she watches all the cinematics that are on YouTube. Her you You heard her presentation was beautiful. That was the site. It's actually helping her with her speech. Oh, that's so cool. Greg is so good to see you. Will I be seeing you on Thursday for a barbecue? And she pulls her chin really far down into her chest. She goes burpee but like okay, like this morning? How did it start this morning? I just listened to the one

Unknown 11:43
where

Unknown 11:46
somebody mentioned hummus mom, her mom asked her she wanted some homeless today. And that reminded me of the Yahoo about what's the best way to give kids hummus homemade hummus at Halloween. So we did listen to that and how it's easier if you really want to kill kids. You should work in a cafeteria and exactly so yeah, I mean the magically But should we decided to two thirds of the family decided two nights ago that we are officially going to start celebrating candle nights. And so yeah, so there's gonna be some carved wooden ducks made out of beloved wooden items. It's the whole thing so we're that's the thing we're going to do. We're getting an early start on candle nights.

And we are we going what we do is we go on Airbnb we look for like a seven bedroom house right? Which is because we all want our own bedroom because we're all fancy gentlemen. And that leads you down some weird paths and in terms of home rental, like you wind up with some pretty funny rentals. And this it let me tell you the the ostentatious mansion that we're staying in on this trip is like the ostentatious mansions ostentatious mansion.

Unknown 20:28
No Victoria. Victoria is very beautiful though.

Unknown 20:30
the right half of this is very pretty.

Unknown 20:35
The left half the left half looks like a Judd Apatow.

Unknown 20:41
I think both.

Unknown 20:43
You have to say that. You have to say that. continuity.

Unknown 21:09
He looks so much like Roman Mars. You should patch and it's a car. That's a compliment. He is a very which one Josh Josh is is like Roman Mars. So Josh

Unknown 21:21
does kind of look like Roman Mars. Wow.

Unknown 21:25
Look at handsome Mr. Mars over there.

Unknown 21:27
Yeah, what's to say? That was a compliment. I'll pass that along.

Unknown 21:30
Yes, it is. It is tell him your employees. Especially one of them. Not that she would ever comment on the bosses appearance but was just like, wow, Josh looks great. Looking out smart. He looks

Unknown 21:43
Josh Josh is gonna be like, which one is Alex?

Unknown 21:47
The only reason he knows me is because I'm falling. Like they're all named Josh.

Unknown 21:51
This looks like

Unknown 21:55
five Josh. The five Josh is you meet and Victoria.

Unknown 22:02
So let's go ahead. Okay. Now when I want a trip like that is coming up. I think you said before, it's can be kind of intense as a lot of spreadsheets and deli meats, and meet and greets. And it can get kind of intense, right?

Unknown 22:15
Yeah, it's like RI. Well, I'm actually curious to get Alex's take on this. But like there's a lot of a lot of conversation happening this week about all the basically unsafe and dehumanizing work conditions in the game industry and in game companies. And I would say like we we really try not to crunch your Cards Against Humanity in the sense of like, maybe unless we're like, at a convention that week, people I really don't think people are ever asked to work more than 440 hours a week or like disrupt their work schedule too much. Certainly, I don't like to do that. Like I like to go home and have my life. And I hope our employees have that too. But like leap for me at least like week going into these retreats. This is about as much crunches I have in my life is like we all try to get everything ready for the treat. And then we just have these like, long days of I mean, we're in a beautiful place. So I can't really complain. But like it there. They're like long and

Unknown 23:11
I know but it's been around. I can't convince my wife of this. I mean, this is something that is has become such a temple for me. It's It is so privileged but but attention takes energy being around people, even people you like takes energy. So like when we had that event that we went to this she was running, she'd be like, How come? Why am I so tired? And like cuz you had to be nice to people all day. Like if you have to be just around people all day. I'm especially for women. In most cases like you. There's a lot of like smiling you have to do, but no, I don't think I realized you don't want to sound like a privilege, Dick. But like, Yeah, no, that's intense to have to hang around with the five Joshua's all day and eat meat is, you know, that can be a

Unknown 23:52
it's also like, I don't know if people have been in this kind of creative situation. But like, there's this thing of like, you know, sometimes we're struggling, we can't, our ideas aren't working, and we can't figure out what to do. And then everything seems to crumble, like the friendship start to crumble and everyone gets mad at each other and we start bickering. And then you have like a breakthrough. And you're like, oh my god, like something's working. And now we're all like late now we're all like this. The highs are so high and the lows are so low. But this morning, last night, we had a very good play test. With our friends are loading ready, Ron, and I think we woke up and we all feel like very energized and encouraged and today's content is going to grow. I think we're, I think yesterday, we had a little bit of the dark night of the soul of not really knowing what to do next. And then we had a very validating play test last night, and this morning, we're all just like, Fuck, yeah, like we can do this. Like everyone. I don't know, you know, cards got bigger than, you know, whatever, the seven of us making something and our parents basement and now there's a lot of pressure of like, Damn, if we don't come up with something funny right now. Like it's all over. Like the office goes away all the people sitting on the bouncy balls, the podcast studio, expensive Dickerson microphones at all goes away. And thinking about that in the back of your mind is like I would say like not, you know, not funny, like no one wants to be doing comedy writing thinking about if I don't come up with a great joke in the next 45 seconds the bouncy balls go away.

Unknown 25:12
Yeah. Well, yeah, I mean, like, it's, I was gonna say this, because it's so obvious. And everybody knows it intellectually. But everybody knows intellectually that the worst thing you can do, to be truly creative is to put the wrong kind of unnecessary pressure on yourself. And like, everybody knows that, like you don't, you don't get truly creative results by yelling at people or by increasing the amount of anxiety for most people. Unless that's part of the process that works for you. But like, even though you know, that's the case, it's kind of impossible not to and then you get mad you get emotional. Or you get maybe you feel not heard. Maybe you feel you know what I mean, not valued. And then you're like, man, least I am on my heart. Right? I put all the dishes away and nobody said anything where and like the I think that's difficult even when you know, in a actually a you you do this for a profession. I think for most people, it's still really challenging.

Unknown 26:05
Alex

Unknown 26:14
Cameron, I tell people, I'm looking for freelance if this doesn't go, well. Boy, you guys need to this one. There's, there's a constant thought of like, yes, if the guys don't make something brilliant. We're all We're all doomed and everything's terrible. And I am. I am somewhat lucky in that the only time I'm involved with making card stuff is like, is this funny to the queer people? And then it's like a poll to all the queer people really reassuring the guys? Yes, this is indeed funny. But especially play testing the new game, which is like one of my favorite things to do. It is constantly scary. The new game is so good now. It was

Unknown 27:02
bad. It went from bad to good. Yeah, no, it's, it's all it's fixed. Now.

Unknown 27:07
It's, it's, it's very difficult. Especially because, like, I also am lucky that I am, again, like creatively removed from most everything except interpreting feedback, which is another stressful part of like, and not just cards, like this is every game or anything ever when you're trying to do like, like the fucking series stuff. Like, I mean, obviously, this is just a tiny, tiny, tiny thing compared to that, but relaying information and making sure it's accurate and making sure folks aren't lying to you so that you that you know, everybody's having a fun, good experience. It's like, Well, are you saying this is good thing? Because I'm your friend. Are you saying this is a good thing? Because you know what Cards Against Humanity is and it's like a constant. Like, okay, well, I really hope everyone still has a job tomorrow. And it then you think about it for one minute and you're like, that's completely irrational in every sense, just in every single way. But it's just I don't know who doesn't think they're going to lose their job every day. Yeah. Okay, let's see. All right. No, no, no.

Unknown 28:20
I'm I'm thinking about it. It's

Unknown 28:24
Yeah, sucks.

Unknown 28:25
It's like Okay, so what happens the day Maddie and I stopped being cute to the internet like that's gonna happen at some point. Like, I'm always like, all right, when's the day the internet turns on me like when what is the thing I did in high school? That will we've gone way off the rails but it No

Unknown 28:43
we haven't. This gives us an opening to talk about the the wonderful work of GT know your name, right. Did you see that one interview that with with us recording? I mean, really, any interview with her is great. She's so freaking smart.

Unknown 28:58
Yeah, I read the book. She is Yeah, she is my everything. Oh.

Unknown 29:07
I can never tell somebody. mood.

Unknown 29:11
Black lady reactions. Yes. Yeah. Um, but she talks about that. We haven't hinted at this in our pre show the whole like, the way, the way the internet chews through women, you know, and, and you get put up on the pedestal and then you get knocked off the pedestal and it's, you know, yeah, yeah, that sucks. boy, boy, she's good.

Unknown 29:31
She is,

Unknown 29:33
as her time drives me a little bit crazy sometimes. But I do I listened to a show. If I'm into the Gaston, I'm so into that guest. And it she's just so goddamn smart at talking about really, you know, the internet and identity. But also just she said, she said, it's another one of those things where you're like, Yeah, I know all these things that this person says these are all like truisms. But like she puts it, she puts it so well. And so intelligently. And I went actually, Max, this is germane to something from the show you do with Pat, that quote, I'm always borrowing from Pat Rufus, talking about backstage. And onstage. She specifically talks about that. I guess she addressed that in the book.

Unknown 30:11
Yeah, the half of an essay is basically about It's so good.

Unknown 30:15
Yeah. And so I mean, it's not exactly the same thing as past talking about, but it's real close, had had that great line on unintended consequences about not comparing your backstage to other people's on stage. But she's talking about it, which I just I think about all the time. what it was that they say that, you know, comparison is the death of joy or whatever. But also that the thing of the problem, one of the problems with the internet now, especially if you're somebody like she who grew up with the internet, or like Alex, I guess, is that you're never off stage. Like your whole life becomes a performance of who you are a context lyst performance of who you are. And it's physically mentally and emotionally exhausting to feel like you're always on, even when you're not streaming or whatever. And it's that idea, like, putting it that way really hit me, you know what I mean? Just that sense of like, hey, look, you can take something as simple as everybody's got a post. Everybody's got to have a take. Oh, yeah. here's, here's a picture of me with, you know, Mr. Rogers, his pa that just died or whatever. Like, everybody's gotta have a hot taking something to say about it. And I think Instagram just amplifies that 1000 times, personally, but I don't know where I'm going with this. But I just think God told to us great.

Unknown 31:30
Can you give me the clips, the clip, obviously, I know who she is. But could you but maybe our listener listeners might not know her whole deal. Do you want to give us a little Cliff's notes?

Unknown 31:39
I know our listeners will know

Unknown 31:41
what's on the note card have a three words large adult son.

Unknown 31:46
That was on

Unknown 31:47
that New Yorker article on the era of the large adult son that was her. Okay. Remember the remember the piece?

Unknown 31:53
Yeah. Okay. First, she read

Unknown 31:54
that she's the cultural writer person for the New Yorker. And she does other things. And Alex gets the give us the top line give us the log line on her book.

Unknown 32:04
Her book is just like seven essays about the internet and being a millennial and a woman and it all sounds very boring. But if you liked the article, the land of the large adult son, and if you just like her, her book is kind of what I had been waiting for. Like, you know how there there are some influencers and shit like Lena Dunham, who's like, yeah, I'm the voice of her generation. But I bet that, like, whenever I read her work, it seems like oh, yeah, she's got it. She knows exactly what this is and how this is working. And what we're all feeling. Does that sort of make sense?

Unknown 32:44
That book of course, is called trick mirror reflections on self delusion by Sheila Tolentino. Thank you.

Unknown 32:48
Yes. Thank you, Max. I think I think I know that but I don't know if our listeners Yes. Right. Yes, cook well, but she has so many like she has so many like, I just I love the whole way that she presents herself self. I guess gawkers and all bad? Because she's working decibel. But yeah, gawkers all bad. Sorry.

Unknown 33:07
There's a reason there's a use to well,

Unknown 33:11
but never a fan. But, uh, but but but I get why people like it. Blah, blah, blah. I hated it. Before it was cool.

Unknown 33:18
We all want to see the Hulk penis.

Unknown 33:20
Ooh, oh, yeah, right. Right. And those stolen? I think we

Unknown 33:23
all I think we all wake up every morning and we go, boy, if only I could see Hulk Hogan's hog.

Unknown 33:30
I think we can all agree that Nick Denton is a very, very good person.

Unknown 33:33
Yep. And we and you know, you go through life and you're like, I wonder if today's the day when I'm going to see Hulk Hogan's hog. And what kind of what kind of hard hitting what kind of a hard hitting, you know, shoe leather, you know, like, like our old school journalism is going to get us photos of the Hawks hog.

Unknown 33:52
Yeah. Or like, or just, you know, unsubstantiated rumors about people just because they're in tech. That's kind of cool. The way that works. Yeah. It's just fun. That's fun. The way you assailed my friends on purpose for years. That was fun. That was really fun. And good. Thank you, Nick.

Unknown 34:06
You gotta have Nick Denton. He's, he's at his desk, and he's banging his fist on the desk going bring me photos of the Hawks Hawk.

Unknown 34:14
He's dancing around in the suit.

Unknown 34:15
Yeah. You know, it's like everyone's got to have I think that that's the lesson from Gawker is that there's, there's always something in life that's worth, you know, it's like at some point, they'll push you and they can push you know, further and there's, there's something that's worth dying for. And you go, you know, it's like, it's like, I will die on this hill. Right? They could they could never take our freedom can give

Unknown 34:35
him the hug. Give me the hug. Give me the hug. Yeah,

Unknown 34:37
yeah. And showing the world photos of Hulk Hogan's penis as his noble causes i think is also it's also really ever sort of lay down their life. It's

Unknown 34:45
also really, really cool that their whole brand is fuck everybody. Because everybody's the worst. And boy, We sure are, we aren't as stinker is their whole brand. But if you ever seen anything against any of those props, you're the asshole. That's a fun thing. So what she's what's amazing though, she talks about this, and it's like, she's really like, it's very meta in some ways, because she's great at knowing how to present herself. But she's talked about stuff like after Jesse Bell, she stopped, she says, she stopped worrying about like what strangers said about her on the internet, which, of course, it'll still affect you. And you get death threats and stuff and people saying you dicks or whatever. But like, she seems very sanguine about like her place in life. But the other thing is, she just says again, things that seem kind of obvious, but like, you need to hear it. Stuff like people who get success. Some of the people who get successful these days on the internet are people who not only can tolerate a high level of hostility and what's the what's the word that she used but the basically like if you're somebody who likes to fight is good at fighting and doesn't mind getting fought at you will do better than people who can't because those people will just fall away because it's the worst. And just the nature of in her realizing for example, that like she does not need to respond to every confrontation. She does not need to engage in every fight that somebody wants to start with her. And I don't know I just I find it all just very thoughtful and necessary tonic that I you know, I'm going to read that book. I got the Kindle thing, but I haven't haven't read it yet. I hope it's I hope it's ragged right and not justified. It's Oh, save it for the show. Save it for the show. So do you read the read the whole book? You read the whole book? Did you book a book to book you already? Read you read the whole thing?

Unknown 36:37
I sure planned to but then

Unknown 36:39
No, no, not Disney. GOUCG catch them all.

Unknown 37:08
Did you read the whole deal? You hold your book? All

Unknown 37:11
the hob? Well, all except the one because I've been trying to read a fucking mouse book. Um, but it is the kind of thing that makes you feel less alone in a way that you didn't expect that you needed.

Unknown 37:23
Yeah, she's talking about the thing. She she's the one who's she's pointing to the elephant in the fucking room. That's really, you need that sometimes? Ah,

Unknown 37:32
I don't know. It's like, okay, like, sometimes one day maybe maybe the internet will be normal. Maybe we will all recognize this at one point and just be like, yep, yep, that that's how it is. But it's I hate this term, but it is very much cold water in desert whatever. I totally agree. God bless ice water. Yeah,

Unknown 37:55
yeah. But I mean, like, I have to sit in the portal it for my work. You know what I mean? It's like, we all we all come up with these reasons why we make ourselves so miserable. With how why where and when we use especially in my case, Twitter. And it's like, I don't have a I don't have a sound and reasonable explanation for why I do what I do. It's like you get this Meet me in the chicken. Me in the fried chicken. I always

Unknown 38:20
I always know what I'm going to do before I do it. What what? That's the guy from mine. Hunter remember our great character from mine Hunter.

Unknown 38:29
Oh, I love that guy. Yeah, I love that guy.

Unknown 38:33
That's the thing. I always know what I'm going to do before I do it.

Unknown 38:41
Put off these big glasses.

Unknown 38:43
So this is is this the Olaf character? No or not Olaf?

Unknown 38:47
No, no. reindeers are better than people.

Unknown 38:50
Uh, oh. Wow. Fuck.

Unknown 38:55
Classes Klaus. So does Jonathan Groff doesn't have big glasses, right? As

Unknown 39:01
long as we're never gonna, as long as we're sharing all our unpopular internet opinion. Oh, God put this out. What do you guys think of bedbug Twitter?

Unknown 39:09
Give me your take. I love to see it. You love to see it. I love to see it. I love I love

Unknown 39:15
that much. If you're that much of a of a high status sort of public individual. like God can't don't you kind of expect for people to call you names on Twitter.

Unknown 39:24
Did you read the thing? Did you read the Esquire response?

Unknown 39:27
No, no, I didn't know there was one.

Unknown 39:29
Oh, I know. I know. our listeners might not have so I'll mention it. So. So basically, what happened was Bret Stevens, who is how does one say a piece of shit. I'm one of the many terrible people writing for The New York Times opinion page. Can we just have Jamal buoy like, Can we just have more of that? But now No, Brad Stevens is there and he's terrible. And so so what happened was this guy he was an associate professor. Some colleagues

Unknown 39:57
I mean, if if our listeners I'll share quickly the the thing that the one thing I know card about Brad Stevens, he got hired fairly recently post Trump at the New York Times. And he's kind of one of these. Never Trump conservatives, I think and he got and he got hired at the New York Times.

Unknown 40:10
He's along the lines of David Brooks. He's another one of these very reasonable, you know, center right, Republicans.

Unknown 40:17
Yeah. And he got there was a lot of outcry people like why would in the Trump era like the New York Times be hiring more of these like kind of conservative commentators that like not only do they not represent most people in this country, but they don't even fucking understand what's going on what they

Unknown 40:31
represent New York Times conservative columnist, that's who they represent represent themselves. That's it

Unknown 40:36
is there? Is there a living person who has less insight into the mind of the American public and voter than these never Trump conservatives, but this is all anyway. So everyone was like, then there was sort of this, like, you know, people were like, oh, Brad Stevens. He's a great writer, and he's a really good thinker and give him a chance and don't rush to judgment, everyone and he can't we just can't we just grow up. And then the fucking first thing he writes is like climate changes overblown everyone should say, worrying so much about climate change around like, Oh, here we go. Like, it's it's crazy. Like, I mean, I think I might have let it lapse. But I was in New York Times like home print subscriber, because I had this idea that maybe my life would be better if I would like not go on Twitter and knocking on my phone, but I could like wake up and read the paper. You know, what?

Unknown 41:20
A snap while you're sipping your coffee out of your fists.

Unknown 41:24
And I was like, maybe I'll like get some North the children across the table. It's a good morning for everybody.

Unknown 41:29
Yep. Have the butler ironed out for you? Yeah,

Unknown 41:31
yeah. And I was like, maybe I was like, I would have some sort of like a new perspective or different maybe would change my life in some positive way. If I like didn't go on my phone right away. And I just like, and I just like, you know, get the paper record and you get the facts. You know, just you're good. You get it all out there. Right first thing in the morning. And like, and I and I, the first thing I would do is open the back page of the front section. Just hate read the editorials. There's the op eds. They're just just so bad. I mean, just such lame, out of touch. Milk, awful opinions, just just really, really boring and awful. And and specifically there to troll me. I mean, I think I think a lot of the strategy there is it's things for me to get mad at and post about on Twitter, or people like me.

Unknown 42:12
Oh, I i don't i don't disagree. And I Well, we should save this for the show. Yeah, I think this is this is this is necktie Twitter. So necktie, Twitter. And the thing that I'm realizing is driving drives me crazy just about people like Peter Baker, like he's a good reporter, but he needs us. Okay, so I first noticed this with MSNBC, for obvious reason, which I do not watch anymore. And I'm really glad I made that decision. msnbc needs us to feel like this is the craziest day that Rachel Maddow has ever had to report on they throughout the entire script. And they have to start over because of all the crazy days, this is the craziest day. Brian Williams opens by saying what day of the Trump administration This is and yeah, here we are again. And Chuck Todd goes, Well, if it's Tuesday, it must be me jerking off onto a sponge or whatever the fuck. And you just do this and you got the same bits you got last night you gotta you got Lawrence Lawrence is saying all Deutsche Bank had Russia, cosine, Trump's loans. I don't believe that for a goddamn second. But they need us to feel like we are living through the worst conceivable time it is off balance. And they are the single voice of sanity who is with you on how crazy this is. But the thing that's important about it is like with Fox, it's our Fox, they need us to feel off balance, and the life is understandable. And there's no sympathetic voice to agree with you about how crazy this is, except for them. Peter breakers of the world needs you to feel off balance to they need you to feel that this is a fucking horse race and not so fast. Now that this doesn't happen. Because if this happens, that's going to happen. You haven't thought this through the way the New York Times has. And you know, Maggie does a fair amount of that too. There's a lot of us needing to feel off balance. And then you you take that salt, and then you pepper it with the fucking opinion page. I'm still a subscriber, a happy subscriber. I'm glad they do the work they do. But I don't think of them as my friend, I think of them as a newspaper. And it was it was really dumb with me to think of them as my friend. It's all access journalism. It's all people who need need you to feel like I'm just mad, I'm mad, I get mad, get mad, get mad, and I'm off it.

Unknown 44:27
So, I mean, we should eventually come back to calling Bret Stevens of bed. But

Unknown 44:30
we're gonna you know, we're gonna

Unknown 44:32
We need someone who needs to read the letter because that are the letters amazing.

Unknown 44:37
Yeah, well, I just thought the thing I'll say about the New York Times is like, I think it's a very conservative paper and not in the sense of conservative like, this moment in politics, like a public and paper. Yes. I mean, it's conservative in the sense that it's a whole paper, the thesis of the New York Times is that we don't want really we don't want anything to change. Like, everything is good nowadays, you have to get back to normal. Yes. And it's kind of it's kind of the it's kind of the document of the like, the people who are who've got everything set up the way it is. And they're like, Well, why would we want it to change, like, everything is good how it is. And they have a lot of column space dedicated towards spreading about anything being different. And I think, you know, we're like, obviously, it goes without saying, like, we're living in this moment where a lot of people are fine, the way that things are to be intolerable for them and their families. They're drowning in debt, and they don't have health insurance, and no opportunities in life and whatever, whatever, whatever. But at some point, the side that people are going to pick is I want things to be different than they are, rather than any sort of polite parameter. You know, the other thing The New York Times wants to do is they want to say, well, the, here's what's in within bounds of debating, right? They want to put the rails on the argument and say, Well, you can't say this or that, but these are the things that you can argue over and like fact that like, Who let them decide that?

Unknown 45:59
Yes, yes, I'm second mentioned, it's on second mentioned, we put an honorific in front of somebody's name. Isn't that nice? The way we do that?

Unknown 46:05
Yeah. And and then there was I'll also just throw out there was also that great thing about in the, the Michael Lewis podcast about referees, and if you guys listen to that, but it was, it was really good. But they talked about how all these newspapers are getting rid of their ombudsman and their own sort of internal standards editor. And so yeah, the public editor and it's like so these papers want to police the bounds of the debate for the rest of us of like, Oh, it's not appropriate to call the Trump side of

Unknown 46:32
things which Yeah, we're not going to have Twitter we're not gonna have Twitter tell us that this misleading headline that that the person who wrote the article Didn't they didn't write that headline somebody in the SEO department

Unknown 46:45
but there but but but they're going to go but they holding the New York Times whole thing is they're going to go it's it's not appropriate to call them concentration camps like let's not overreact but also like their own internal processes are all fucked up and they're reporting things that you know their their standards have gone down and they're taking and clicks just like everyone else like it's all it's all fucked up and it makes me resent it

Unknown 47:04
so it's not racist. It's racist hinged.

Unknown 47:06
Yeah. Oh, it's it Yeah. What did they say What did they say he racially charged racially charged

Unknown 47:11
the the so I read before we start recording I was listening to slate show called What next? episodes called reconsidering joe biden's record. And oddly enough to Mel buoy was the was the guest. And I'm going to massacre what he said. But it was so goddamn smart. He was. So he was talking about the Biden thing. And you know, and we all know the Biden thing and what's going on not just the melting brain part, but the like, why people why people thought that they love Joe Biden, they liked joe biden's chances. There's nobody who's excited. He is the BlackBerry of candidates, like nobody is happy about job. Like, is it but they feel like they have to do it right. Um, but he said something so smart. He's like, and I think this does get lost in the lights talking about specifically, I'm going to say Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. And I don't want to get into the whole wound up the whole Chapo thing. I really like Elizabeth Warren. She wants to do things, I do believe that she wants to do things differently. And there's a big difference for there's an axis for where you stand politically. Maybe there's like there's an X axis of where you stand in terms of left and right. But there's also maybe a Y axis of how you feel about those rails, and how you feel about that governing system. And however you feel about joe biden's politics, what is unimpeachable true about Joe Biden is that he is an institutional lyst who likes saying friends with everybody and being being able to cut deals that could have happened in 1988, but aren't going to happen now? And it was sad, or was Sanders I wish Elizabeth Warren is out there, you know, saying no, there's this. There's this big system that needs to be dismantled. It's the system, it's not just where you stand on that spectrum. You know, can we all agree that this, this big system is really screwed up? And that that's, that's getting somewhat lost in the lights in the polls? of all of this stuff? So Brett Stevens.

Unknown 49:04
Yeah, so basically, Brett Stevens is kind of, I would say is like the he's like the, the he's almost like the icon of this whole sort of New York Times ideology. Some guy said there was like an article going around or someone posted on Twitter and they go breaking, there are bed bugs in the New York Times newsroom. And then some random Twitter user who has like 30 followers, Dave cough, some guy named Dave cards with I think he What does he have like 30. Before all this went down, he had like 30 followers and he was like, you know, like, not a major Twitter guy.

Unknown 49:36
He had he had a tweet, he had a tweet with no handle mentioning Brett Stevens, that received I believe, at the time, zero retreats, retweets and nine faves, that somehow Brett Stevens was able to find because obviously, he was searching for mentions of himself, which is super normal and healthy.

Unknown 49:57
Yeah. So he the tweet was so he reached he read to this thing that says there are bedbugs, The New York Times newsroom and he says the bedbugs are Brad Stevens and Brad Stevens of course has a Twitter search for his name and he checks it every five minutes and he finds his tweet and his sends he emails What does he do he snitched on him to like the

Unknown 50:16
he emails the Provost he emails the provost of the college where this guy is a tenured tenure track associate professor. Dear right, Dave? Car dear Dr. Cough, someone just such a Trump move. Someone just pointed out a tweet you wrote about. I'm often amazed about the thing supposedly decent people are prepared to say about other people, people they've never met on Twitter. I think you've set a new standard. I would welcome the opportunity for you to come to my home, meet my wife and kids. Talk to us for a few minutes and then call me a bedbug to my face. That would take some genuine courage and intellectual integrity on your part know about that. I promise to be courteous no matter what you have to say. Maybe will make you feel better about yourself. Let's consider this a standing invitation you are more than welcome to bring your significant other cordially but Stevens see seed to the provost of the university where this guy works.

Unknown 51:13
where he's like, come to my house and tell my wife I'm about I'm a bed bug.

Unknown 51:16
That's the main that's the main portion I'd argue of it other than saying Oh, some someone Someone told me no, this is a this is a fuck us. It's a fuck you sandwich. Yeah,

Unknown 51:28
yeah, it's

Unknown 51:34
considered a standing invitation.

Unknown 51:37
Can you imagine if someone someone insults you on Twitter, and they're like, they're like, Merlin man sucks like he's opinions about about computers are bad. And you'd be like, why don't you come to my house and tell my wife that?

Unknown 51:49
Yes. And just see my little daughter who thinks I'm funny. I'm going to have you fired Sir. Sir. You have set a new standard.

Unknown 51:58
Come over come over to my

Unknown 52:01
Yeah, I need this. I needed to finish Come on, come over fucking pussy,

Unknown 52:05
come to my house.

Unknown 52:08
We come and say you don't like my opinion, my opinions about my opinions about computers.

Unknown 52:14
You came to my house, you fucking pussy.

Unknown 52:17
And I'm gonna I'm gonna, I'm gonna see see your boss, sir.

Unknown 52:22
I need you to come to me, I need you to come to my house. me in front of my wife.

Unknown 52:28
And my pool boy and my trainer.

Unknown 52:36
Well, you know, in Micah, he raped the Lord loves UK.

Unknown 52:41
I think there might be some psychology happening there.

Unknown 52:44
So that's what happened with that. And then Brad Stevens went on to msnbc to talk about this further, and said that there is a totalitarian precedent for calling people insects, and he's just real upset about it. Fast forward, he deleted his Twitter account. David Karp is still there. And he's writing on Esquire. And it led to a tweet from someone this morning that I am going to be thinking about beyond today. And this is what this person wrote. This is David Calyon. I don't know what his deal is directly on news editor, Jewish currents and writer at the nation. And he links to Dave carps response in Esquire, which is really good. I recommend it, I'll put it in notes. Here's what this guy said, in linking to this article, quit tweeting it. I don't think anyone can seriously dispute that Dave Karp is a better, smarter and more ethical writer than Brad Stevens. So why Stevens the one with a tenured column at New York at the New York Times? The answer is that conservatism is a jobs program for mediocre white people.

Unknown 53:49
Oh,

Unknown 53:53
good. So give it a minute. Give it a minute. It's got levels, because you know, you know what those guys hate? They hate all those make work programs, blacks. Title line? Affirmative Action. That's for people who can't achieve. I'm an urban achiever. No, you're not. It's a jobs program for mediocre white people. I love it so much.

Unknown 54:13
Wow, that's so good. Oh.

Unknown 54:20
slowly turned into a corn cob.

Unknown 54:35
I don't think we could ever put this episode out. What are you talking about? We're gonna post this

Unknown 54:41
all right. Oh, my God.

Unknown 54:44
Have you just started doing that? Have you just started doing that as a defense mechanism wise? Why would you?

Unknown 54:50
Hop Are you old?

Unknown 54:52
I'm old. I'm not old.

Unknown 54:56
out the part where I'm talking about fucking dolphins on the rest will be fine. Hey.

Unknown 55:02
I missed some stuff.

Unknown 55:03
But it's funny. I'm digging digging digging challenge

Unknown 55:08

Unknown 55:10
We might have had some other shit.

Unknown 55:20
wacky Justin

Unknown 55:25
vape. Ok. So now

Unknown 55:31
Oh,

Unknown 55:32
oh, I know I have a I have a little bit of a. I have a little bit of an iOS thing. So I switched. You know, I'm obsessed with like, how I get news and how I

Unknown 55:40
know I read news.

Unknown 55:43
All the time. Okay, me. Yeah. So I'm off. I'm off of

Unknown 55:47
set, please hit.

Unknown 55:49
I'm off of No, not off Twitter. I'm off. I'm off of Apple news. Whoa, wow. You know, you know, we always make fun of apple. We always make fun of Apple news for like, coming up with these ridiculous headlines. Oh, it's stuff like that. So I'm on to google news app. And I think it's a little better. And I don't know if you guys have tried it.

Unknown 56:07
I look at Google News constantly drives me crazy. Okay. But that's where I go for news aggregation. I'm sorry to say

Unknown 56:14
That's right. That's what I got for you and and I find the for you thing like useless like it's showing me a lot of shit about the the Popeye's chicken sandwich, which I guess maybe Google knows I've, I've clicked on some links about that. And it's showing me lots of like, I also get a lot of like comedy casting news. Like I have a lot of like SNL casting news, I

Unknown 56:31
give you a hot tip. Yes, I don't know if there's a way I will say it this way. I doubt there's a way to do this on iOS. But if you're looking at if and when you're looking at it on desktop, let me go there and see how you do this. And you're seeing some more shit you don't like First of all, they have one of those probably pointless see less often type buttons, which I'm not sure it's hooked up to anything. But what it will do, that's cool. There's an area where you can go and manually say new sources that you don't want to see. But for a given link story, you can mouse over those three vertical dots for more, and click and say hide stories from this new source. So if you're getting a lot of like, you know, Android testers today, or whatever, like you could say, like, I don't want to see this anymore. I just don't show me stuff from these people at all. So like the first time Perez Hilton finds his way into your attention, you can say, I'm good. Thank you. That does that does help.

Unknown 57:24
So Google also has like a dedicated tab for they have one thing that that's for you, which I find to be pretty useless. And another one called headlines, and I find their headlines thing to be pretty good.

Unknown 57:34
Yeah, and they but again, I I mostly use this on the desktop. But another neat thing they've done fairly recently is they they automatically cluster what they believe to be similar stories into like a little package for you. And you can click on View full coverage. And then what I love is in the upper right, it's sorts by relevance by default, but you can also sort by date. So if you just want to see the latest hot news. What's up the latest stories to the top? One in this case that President Trump thinks the Puerto Rico is very ungrateful. In terms of rain.

Unknown 58:15
Oh my God, He sure is mad about fake news.

Unknown 58:20
normal one. Yeah, yeah, I was saying that Alex earlier, the things can drive me crazy right now. Oh, you saw us on the channel. God fucking amp. Maybe it's just an iOS 13 thing. But like when I land on amp, Google amps story, which is basically they amplify pretty much everything coming out of Google searches and news. And, you know, they're there. were like, if you don't want that, you're kind of out of luck. There are add ons and Android that you can get. But in iPhone, your option is to just not use Google basically. And app sucks. And one of the things I've seen Alex, it's hard to articulate, but I think this might be a 13th thing. But when I land on any apps story, I know instantly because the second I tried to scroll it does this weird jittery hopping on the page which is ironic, given that the whole point of app is supposed to slim down pages. I want to be gone. I want to be totally gone. I wish Guardian would add that. Guardian is my new answer to everything are using Guardian Alex.

Unknown 59:17
The Guardian

Unknown 59:18
DVPM plus VPN plus firewall for your phone. Oh,

Unknown 59:21
no, I don't like

Unknown 59:23
plus firewall. So should. Okay, guardian. Okay, I'll check it out. I you know, I have a lot of paranoia about VPN.

Unknown 59:31
I know you should. You should you should this that I'm setting aside the VPN part because that's official. I ran across an article the other day, I kind of wish I could find it again. But it evaluates all the VPN for all kinds of things. So if you're a Chinese dissident, like you need to be looking at that table because there's all kinds of good look forward out there. It's not the torrent frequent, but there is one that drills into a ton of detail. I don't do trust the people at guardian and the firewall party is

Unknown 1:00:03
crazy. What What is this? Can you explain what the fight I don't actually know what a firewall is?

Unknown 1:00:09
Oh, ok. So like it like if you ever used a little, like, for example, a Little Snitch to reuse that?

Unknown 1:00:13
Yes. So me my computer and made my computer break.

Unknown 1:00:17
Well, Little Snitch sucks for a couple days, but eventually is great. So

Unknown 1:00:22
wait, wait, what is Little Snitch

Unknown 1:00:26
Little Snitch is an app from Little

Unknown 1:00:28
snitches. The guy that if you tweet about Brad Stevens he replies underneath and he goes

Unknown 1:00:33
Sir, you set a new standard sir. A little snitches. I think my ob Deb I think it's about the people do Launch Bar. And basically, it lets you know every time something is trying to connect in or out to your computer, and then you approve deny whatever, on a per thing basis. So go to Guardian app.com. And so what what they say. So let's set aside the VPN part for a minute. So what they're saying here is your control your data. As to 56 encryption network traffic, real time intelligent firewall is the head. Our number one priority is to find threats before they find you. We periodically scan code available within the app store for security vulnerabilities, privacy issues, invasive trackers, and more. Initially, we can detect phishing malware, aggressive advertising and other traditional security nuisances.

Unknown 1:01:25
So here, if

Unknown 1:01:27
you notice, is there things you notice where so I use? What's the really good Safari? ad blocker on iOS?

Unknown 1:01:37
Use of 111

Unknown 1:01:41
raise this one?

Unknown 1:01:42
Yeah, I use Is that it? One blocker x so

Unknown 1:01:47
much running? I don't even know anymore? I have on this is on the hobby.

Unknown 1:01:53
Yeah, one. So I have one blocker x. And occasionally for whatever reason, I'm using an iOS device without one block or x or I use like a like I used to go Yeah, yeah. It's like doesn't work with it.

Unknown 1:02:03
It's like the day live glasses.

Unknown 1:02:04
Yes. And you know,

Unknown 1:02:06
like, I take it for granted. But this thing. This is what the internet

Unknown 1:02:09
is like for you every day every day. This is what it's like.

Unknown 1:02:14
Oh my god, I need to put an ad there. Holy shit.

Unknown 1:02:17
Yeah. This thing is improving my life. So much do you have that with with Guardian firewall plus VPN on the iOS App Store.

Unknown 1:02:24
I don't know what's even doing what anymore. I'm running so much shit. But look at the thing I just sent. And, and so the one downside I will say to this is so the upside is it identifies things that are trying to do weird shit with your location data. But in particular, it bands data trackers of all of many, many sorts. Now what it doesn't do is say which app just did it but I have found that you can kind of find out by basically let's say you open Guardian, you go and launch a suspicious app and then look at the activity that just happened. Guardian in kind of fake it. So you can see in the two weeks or so I've been using this it's block 4442 data trackers. So I don't know if it's working, I'm sure john Syracuse can find a reason to tell me this is all in my head. But I think it's kind of cool. And it's so you sign up $10 a month for I've got running on several devices. And the only the only problem I know of that I've run into is that if I try to watch Hulu on an iOS device, it says hey, you know you're running a VPN? You gotta turn that off.

Unknown 1:03:30
Oh, it gets deep in there.

Unknown 1:03:32
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And, and I've tested it a little bit lately with having an on and off. And as I said, today, and the only time I've noticed a significant hit, is when I'm on a very bad connection. Like, you know what I mean? Like, if you're on like, really, you know, a 3g ish connection, you will know, we trust

Unknown 1:03:48
we trust their VPN, we don't think their VPN is like a state actor trying to harvest all our data. I mean, you know, you know you how much you have to trust that

Unknown 1:03:56
the VPN? I definitely think it is and that's that's specifically why I'm using it. Yeah. No, it's

Unknown 1:04:00
the guy is saying like,

Unknown 1:04:02
I don't know, I don't know, Max. I don't know. You have to decide if you use the internet. You have to trust somebody.

Unknown 1:04:11
This is the jailbreak guy, and he seems legit.

Unknown 1:04:14
It's the jailbreak guy. The jailbreak guy. Okay, well, I like I like that guy. Yes, cool. Cool, improvised. Maybe he's been compromised, and he's a CIA asset.

Unknown 1:04:25
Who's not at this point? guardian. jailbreak guy.

Unknown 1:04:31
Yeah. I mean, what's the, uh, the like, over under on how VPN work when you have more than one installed like how, right that's what I can never I think you

Unknown 1:04:43
can only have Well, I don't know this, but I mean, I've used cloud flare. Like is cloud flare I've used the you know, the one dot 12121 I've used the I've used I like Express VPN that seems good. Let me see if I can find this for maximum buzzes The thing is if you don't if you don't trust somebody you'll never trust anybody.

Unknown 1:05:03
So the one that I have that I recommend so here's how I the first thing is I recommend everyone make their own judgment call for VPN and do not really rely on like the recommendations of your friends or whatever because they don't know what the hell they're talking about. So what do you use it what do you use how many pod NE comedy podcast but what I can recommend to people as the torrent freak doesn't annual VPN?

Unknown 1:05:22
Why do you trust torrent freak they're stealing movies.

Unknown 1:05:26
So I trust torrent freak because they're all they're a news site the report reports on like the torrent world, but they do interviews with all this journalism companies. And they talk about do they have to they have like offshore server tip torrent freak you want that would be the one that torrent free to VPN round up. And they all they do is they have like a feature comparison of all the major VPN

Unknown 1:05:49
I mentioned at five minutes ago.

Unknown 1:05:54
Five minutes. They talk about

Unknown 1:05:55
if they keep logs and freaking us and stuff. Yeah, it's called the torrent freak.

Unknown 1:06:04
I can never tell

Unknown 1:06:06
you that.

Unknown 1:06:09
It's been a couple of weeks since he's repeated a story from the previous

Unknown 1:06:13
Exactly.

Unknown 1:06:15
Is there are the men and black guys there that day doing the little flashlight?

Unknown 1:06:22
Were they taking a day off?

Unknown 1:06:25
I would love to find this because, you know, I was I was actually in that hotel room. You know, where my family was staying? When I installed this. And I you know, I found myself looking around. And I said I want to find this. It was it's VPN. But it goes into extreme detail about like, you know, one of the things everybody says with this stuff, and I don't want to get too into this, because I don't really want to talk I don't want to be talked to about this. A lot depends on where stuff is hosted. But there's a reason people like something called proton mail, whatever that is, because of where it is hosted. There's there are reasons that people like certain VPN being inserted certain places, because where they're hosted, like these things matter, like do they were it? What do they retain? How can you pay for this, all those things will matter to somebody, in this case, the you know, the the notional Chinese dissident, right? Like somebody where this really matters a lot like the granularity of not simply comatose, berzin or not. But down to like some extreme details were sort of like, you know, you always look at Apple and the way they say, look, we don't even want to wait to get into your data. You know what I mean? We not only do we not want your data, you know, like, everybody, like there's still so like, gay bones for Spotify. And it's like, hey, Spotify wants to give me more data. And I'm like, you know what, I'm real good to not even know that data. I want to know how many downloads of this podcast there was because that's what advertisers want. And that's literally all I care about. I don't want any of your data and I don't want you to have mine.

Unknown 1:07:48
Oh, can we see what are Can we see what the do by Friday listeners are listening to on Spotify? Do we have that's

Unknown 1:07:53
a really good that's a really good question. Did we ever get those stats?

Unknown 1:08:00
What's up like couple months now How's it going? I said Remember what I said I remember what I said. I said sure. So as we get the stats they'll get back

Unknown 1:08:10
out in the next release Mark can we like

Unknown 1:08:12
not have their their analytics product or whatever?

Unknown 1:08:14
We were We were we had the privilege max the privilege privilege being on there before they had opened it up to everybody. So no, we don't have that.

Unknown 1:08:24
Oh, no, no, but it wasn't we who put us there? It

Unknown 1:08:26
was no No, no host our

Unknown 1:08:28
podcast who gave us the privilege of putting us on Spotify.

Unknown 1:08:31
Spotify, that's really good for us. That sounds like a big opportunity for us.

Unknown 1:08:37
Oh, it's so good. It's so huge for us. I mean really, if you could be part of the rounding error that is

Unknown 1:08:43
siloed podcast. Oh my gosh, that's so amazing.

Unknown 1:08:48

no time to talk about the mouse book.

Unknown 1:09:55
I have a lot of thoughts on the municipal highway system in in Orlando.

Unknown 1:10:00
That's where I for me it's 75 maybe. Yeah.

Unknown 1:10:04
Merlin this was a little toggle you're talking about in the after show. No, no, we'll do a quick let's just touch I'm actually very excited about the book although I don't think I read enough of it to to give my a full account. You know, thoughts I'm

Unknown 1:10:16
gonna need I think Alex and I are gonna need a few minutes just to talk about type setting though.

Unknown 1:10:20
Oh my fucking golly

Unknown 1:10:22
shit. So no, you know, it's boring. Save it for the after show. But here's the thing. Here's the thing, if you're going to put out an E book, and you can only have it be justified in one way. Please don't have it be full justified with no hyphenation if you have to choose one that will flow to different sizes and won't require any extra work for you. Why wouldn't you make that ragged right? Because there's there's there's rivers and valleys and orphans and Phillies and what is happening? I can't even look at this thing I love I enjoyed reading this book, except for how much I hated reading this book. It was it's extremely shading to read a book to get it to a size where you can read it with my eyes with fully justified text. It's a fucking train wreck. It's an aesthetic train wreck. It's more than aesthetics, though. Like it's hard to read. It's there's like four sometimes there's four words on a line with an inch of space between them. It's crazy. This is Microsoft Word solve this in the 80s you're a computer company could make it good. Do better was wild. I haven't seen this since its old ones. It's when there's an old recent newer books almost always will allow me to have my preferred ragged right and will let you do lots of stuff. This one This one ships only with all the justification options, alignment options are shut off. You can't reach it's grayed out. You have to have like full justified with no hyphenation.

Unknown 1:11:56
I literally thought that was impossible because there was that period where Kindle was just all fucked up. And it was it wasn't quite as bad. But you just can't force it. It it stays. I would have rather read a PDF of it.

Unknown 1:12:09
There's no sighs I could either I put on my glasses, and I turned the light the brightness really far up and I said okay, maybe I'm just an old man. And I should see this at a smaller type size. And that'll make it prettier. No, no. ugly. It's ugly in a different way. With every setting I had access to that ugly, unreadable anyway. So we read a book did it did a challenge called married to the mouse. And I learned about this from listening to an episode of a podcast I really liked called Nice try with a very tough woman. Remember, tough woman. And she has this great podcast about field utopias. And the most recent episode was kind of a weird one, but really good. It was a live episode where she chatted with this woman about the world of I don't say disney world because it's more than Disney World. It's also celebration. They talked about Disney. Just the whole like Disney as utopia idea what Walt wanted to do. And that's where I learned about this book called married to the mouse. They both read the book in prep for this podcast episode. And I thought it'd be fun for us knowing that we all have our own different kind of weird attachments to certain Disney things. I thought it'd be fun for us to read a chapter so have married to the mouse.

Unknown 1:13:15
Well, um, I got about 5% in a and I'll send you the exact page I stopped at because I know well yes, we just talked about it. That was the smallest I could get it to to like actually read it without giving me a headache and then I got a headache because oh my god anyway, so I was just like, you know, no, no, and I planned on priming it But no, you can only buy it used so it's on I plan to read all this but I

Unknown 1:13:47
think it's out of print.

Unknown 1:13:49
It literally gave me a headache to read.

Unknown 1:13:51
It's so bad no matter what. You have any problem. Well, wait a minute. Hang on. Max isn't talking. Max has aesthetic interest. No,

Unknown 1:13:59
I can. I kept trying to jump in. But you guys can hear me? Uh, no, it doesn't bother me that much. I mean, I recognize that it's correct it like everyone should types out their books correctly, but it just doesn't bother me as much as it bothers you guys.

Unknown 1:14:13
It's not even

Unknown 1:14:14
look at that. Look at that sentence. Look at that second sentence. The second line of the first new paragraph found in both relationships period when look at that line look at the look at the spacing on that line.

Unknown 1:14:29
I'm like I said like I know I recognize that it's I recognize that it's not correct and I would never ship something like this but it doesn't it just I have to say like I get into such a flow of like I'm so interested in what I'm reading I just don't even notice that like for me it's it's

Unknown 1:14:44
I get into a flow putting it down and watching mine hunter

Unknown 1:14:47
that's that's what I was surprised. My head it gave me a headache. Yeah, I was looking I actually I have some old high school textbooks and I went back and was looking them and I thought maybe I just my eyes had been trained to read better looking stuff. But no, there was just something about it. It broke my head and like I that I know of the one thing that I don't think I have any learning to submit well, learning disabilities in regards to like looking at words, and it just broke my brain and I couldn't do it. This is the first time that has ever happened to me and I've I'm a very like Syracuse type. I've been reading ebooks on my I read it on my iPod Touch. I read it on frickin Palm Pre but that this book finally broke. It just it broke me and I'm like, I'm just gonna buy the normal fucking book.

Unknown 1:15:42
Maybe we should just suggest that people listen to that episode. guys try. Don't read this book as it is. It's unreadable. Well, except for max. Matt. Did you

Unknown 1:15:52
like Zig in the book? I was digging the book. I wasn't good. Isn't it kind of digging the political intrigue in of the what the movie is that the movie movers and shakers and how the movers and shakers look like a industry capture of all of the South Florida boards and political offices.

Unknown 1:16:10
I love the opening day

Unknown 1:16:14
where they don't reveal where it is who it is what is happening. We just give you telling me you're telling me opening

Unknown 1:16:21
the alright spoiler horns.

Unknown 1:16:24
I think it's something like Disney didn't like for it. Oh, here I'll just pull it up, not eyebrows. Walt Disney didn't say anything. He nearly raised his right eyebrow in response to the offending remark. His staff was seated around him. And then it goes on to talk about this dinner party. But before that, it's it's like Disney. It gives a quick like recap of guests. You know, Walt Disney, you know who he is everybody wants to buy Disneyland or get Disneyland properties into there. And it turns out that Walt Disney has just been offended. By the May I think it was the mayor of St. Louis

Unknown 1:17:02
or no, it's just it's a Gustus bush from bush brewing. And the guy behind stuff like Busch Gardens later on.

Unknown 1:17:09
I thought he was also the mayor or whatever. So the bush garden guy well,

Unknown 1:17:13
but it was a Gustus bush. But the funny part is, it's a Gustus bush from the beer Empire who say no way can you have any kind of amusement park where you don't don't serve alcohol.

Unknown 1:17:23
And it just set Disney off apparently. And that is why and the the chapter like ends or at least the anecdote ends and that's why Disneyland disney world isn't in St. Louis. And it's just so

Unknown 1:17:34
good that's it he just walked away it's like it was gonna you know that that was his choice. And yeah, it's it's so good and then but like you know, just all the details that everybody from Florida anyway knows and Disney nerds now about why he chose the spot he did in Orlando, you know, the flyover and this where these two highways come together. There's no black people. And like all the things that he was really looking for. No, I added that but it's true.

Unknown 1:18:00
No, it's true. Yeah.

Unknown 1:18:05
The door
