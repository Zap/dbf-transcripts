Unknown 1:03
So I guess it's just I guess we're having a boys night this week.

Unknown 1:07
We've earned it boys nights. We're gonna get a limo and smoke cigars.

Unknown 1:12
I've been. I've been I've been getting pulled a little bit back into Twitter. And I guess you were out. I was doing a good job. You have to give up the for me for how much I used to. I've gone from using Twitter like five hours a day to like 15 minutes a day. You talk so

Unknown 1:30
much about Twitter for somebody who doesn't use Twitter

Unknown 1:32
because will because it's the center of like my entire world, like everyone I know is like getting into Twitter drama and posting memes. Like I'm in our super secret thread and we send each other you know, Jen, yes. And we send each other funny tweets. I don't know. Like Merlin vine vine is dead and how often to you and I like cold vine. All right.

Unknown 1:51
No, you're right. Yeah, I I was on a guest on a podcast the other day and I said this thing where it's like, I fucking hate there's so much but our entire for me in my world. Everything always comes back to Trump and or Twitter. There's nothing that's not Trump or twitter at this point. And it's because I mean, you can't say anything on Twitter or somebody doesn't make a Trump joke. Yeah. And it's like it I don't know. It just all seems to like it's just

Unknown 2:18
I've been feeling very upset the well, in general, there's been a lot of concentration camp news this week. And then yesterday, concentration camp day on Twitter where you know, summer camp, and they would have been days and like, this is flag week or like, you know, like Uh huh, you know, it's like music week at camp and like, it feels good. This is like concentration camp week and the Trump administration and that's not a good week.

Unknown 2:42
No, no, I'm it's God see what

Unknown 2:47
it must be working because we're talking about it.

Unknown 2:50
Well, it's Jesus fucking Christ. It's like they said in the onion Did you see the onion? Yeah, I think I think I retweeted that. The Onion was very funny and it was really true.

Unknown 3:00
No, wait, I didn't hear I didn't see a Marlin. What

Unknown 3:02
was it? Was it Holocaust? Holocaust survivors. Remember the day the Holocaust suddenly happened?

Unknown 3:09
everything was going great. There's been no oppression, no brown shirts walking in the streets, something called the Gestapo came to get us.

Unknown 3:15
Yeah, all of a sudden, we were brought into these ghettos that were built, I guess overnight. Yeah, I

Unknown 3:20
mean, you know, and but that's, that's why it's so great. I mean, as always the you know, the story is funny, but the headlines everything. But I know that that's the thing. And it's the weapon of concentration camps by people on the right is, I mean, what do you begin to say you can argue with somebody about that?

Unknown 3:35
It's crazy, because and also, like, I have to acknowledge it works. Like I felt I felt that it was very effective

Unknown 3:41
that faith works. That's why people use it bad faith is a is easy to weaponize,

Unknown 3:45
it was, you know, yesterday, we should have rightfully been having a debate over the constant VK. What is definitively concentration camps on the US Mexico border full of immigrants and extra judicial detention, who've had the right system ended and they're subjected to various types of torture, and they die in custody. And they have unclear release dates that are shifting all the time. You know, all that classic stuff that we know and love about concentration camps. And somehow, I guess the right wing like trolls, they started they were like, well, we don't, we would really prefer not to talk about that. I mean, that's not the That's not the thing.

Unknown 4:18
I can't believe you, I can't believe you would take the historical legacy of how important concentration camps were and use it to apply that to something as trivial as a bunch of immigrants being fenced in under under a bridge. How dare you, sir? How dare you.

Unknown 4:33
They were also like, they were going like, Oh, this you're calling them concentration camps like dishonors is cultural appropriation and it dishonors all of the Jewish people who that's a very triggering term for instance, shut the fuck up. Like that's not even your that first of all, that shit doesn't even sound good when we say it. And second of all, you don't care about that. That is like it's so it's so noxious.

Unknown 4:53
This is you know, so let's say this is tough. It's a tough day for me. Because I really do I do feel for the Jews because I as you know, a gun rights activist. I feel like there should be no movement at all on the issue of gun rights until people learn the difference between a jacket a bullet and a slug. For example, you are not qualified.

Unknown 5:12
What about the bumps? What about the pump stocks

Unknown 5:14
the bug see though there's there's no bump and there's no stock? And like when people say it's not you know, an AR is not an assault rifle. So I'm not going to have that conversation. You can't listen, listen, if you can't be troubled to learn the difference between a work camp, a death camp and a concentration camp. You have no right to dishonor the legacy of these people that I don't actually care about. I

Unknown 5:34
all these also, like there's so many people getting offended on behalf of Jews and like talking, you know, like talking about concentration

Unknown 5:40
camps. You're like the nude, you guys are like the new trans people. Everybody's mad for you.

Unknown 5:44
Yeah, it's crazy. And like, I'll say like I've had this conversation with with many, many Jewish friends over the last few years, but like, probably the one of the predominant parts of Jewish identity of American Jewish identity in the late 20th century, from my experience, was constantly hearing about the Holocaust constantly going to Holocaust museums constantly being told that it could happen here and that you need to be vigilant and hearing stories of people who only survived because they fled early enough to recognize the signs it's this looming it's this looming specter over your life as a young Jewish child in America is you know, an American like the 19 It

Unknown 6:21
feels like you're taught to literally never forget like yeah, it's just like we're not gonna have the opportunity to forget because we're going to be constantly there just from from hearing you and other friends I have youth constantly reinforced in so much of the fabric of your not just your religious rights, but in your entire culture is this sense of like this should happen nobody

Unknown 6:39
believed it, but it happened. And and post-holocaust a lot of you know, it seems to me like a lot of the big Jewish holidays that you do stuff for like like Purim and and a Passover and you know, the ones that that even if you're not that religious, you sort of recognize in some way they become sort of reinterpreted to be about the Holocaust, because they're all holidays about times when people tried to kill the Jews, and we were too clever and a few of us survived. That's the lesson of every Jewish

Unknown 7:06
small business and

Unknown 7:06
now Yeah, now we eat and

Unknown 7:09
I know you're in your house. Yeah.

Unknown 7:11
And and and so it's like it's just it's like multiple times a year the experience for me as a kid was the whole family we get together and we tell stories about the Holocaust and my grandpa would get mad at people at anyone in our family who bought a German car and and you talk and I would lie awake in bed wondering I would have nightmares about not being real honest to God. night terrors about Nazis. You know, you'd worry about I would ask my parents like well what if someone comes to get us you know, and and you just go down that rabbit hole like I have such clear clear very very clear childhood memories of being very scared of this thing happening and anyway so all the people I just it's just don't tell Jewish people that what isn't isn't a concentration camp Don't worry about us being offended by it we've already we've already you know, like like more like you said, thought the problem into a into a into a powder in our mind.

Unknown 8:00
You're not the first ones to tell us about the Holocaust buddy.

Unknown 8:03
Yeah, and also like also there for sure. I will tell you as the Jewish version for sure their concentration camps like 100% their concentration camps and you to the listeners of the Dubai for a program, whatever. Maybe you thought you know, you've been reading some book about World War Two and you're like, Oh, I wonder what I would have done if that happened and I was alive You know what I have tried to kill Hitler or or rescue people and break people out of the out of the concentration camps. Like what what heroism would I have done to resist the Nazis? It's whatever the fuck you're doing now. You would have played fortnight and vape on your jewel pie your mango juul pods like you wouldn't want to shit you would have gone you would have gone on Twitter and made the names about Drake at the basketball game you wouldn't have you wouldn't have you wouldn't have done shit and and to all of the Jews who all of the conservative fucking Zionist Jews on Twitter who are who are whining and crying ago babies and saying they're not concentration camps and they're offended not only would you have done nothing to resist the Nazis, but you probably would have turned me oh,

Unknown 9:00
OK to turn me Oh, it's Alex here is how's that going?

Unknown 9:04
Your your fucking collaborators your your differential? There fishy the VCU Are you there deferential to like a fascist regime? They've learned nothing from Jewish history. And and there could be they could they could really be no way to learn less from Jewish history than to be a Jewish person on Twitter yesterday going well they're not really concentration camps because of someone so

Unknown 9:27
I mean, you know, this here is on both sides. Um, let me take some of the heat off you by saying some as we like to say politically incorrect things

Unknown 9:34
don't you feel like you're going crazy like isn't like the war in Iraq of like, are you people seeing this? Hello? Well, yeah,

Unknown 9:41
I do. Hello, hello. I do I feel like I feel like these people hell's

Unknown 9:46
wrong with everyone. I know.

Unknown 9:48
I know. I it's too much. It's all too much. Yes. But this first part of the bad faith problem. We're

Unknown 9:54
talking about the Garfield restaurant I don't know,

Unknown 9:56
holy shit.

Unknown 9:59
Where do you find Lucy issues? You got to talk to please save it for the show. Here's the thing. That one of the hallmarks of there's probably hope, good books about this. But one of the hallmarks of bad faith arguing is when you choose some kind of a topic or a reference that you consider to be a cultural Mic drop. Were like once once you've talked about this thing, maybe it's sort of like Godwin's law in some ways. It doesn't have to be Hitler. We're watching the Holocaust. There's other things. There's a phrase that people have used in the past we don't use this phrase anymore. But I'm the starving African child. It was was emblematic of this. Where there is there is this thing that happened after we became aware of the the current world in the 80s it was, you know, the African famine of course before that there'd been famines and many other countries that were terrible. You know, China had a terrible famine, but you know, it really was a legit awful and it was solving it was more problematic than anybody had thought, including Bob Geldof. But after everybody became aware of that, that became the cost celeb, understandably, because there were all these photos like people cared about the Vietnam War. Once you started seeing photos of people whose bodies blown apart, people cared a ton about like, legit cared about what the fuck can I do to save these children that are covered with flies in Africa? Like what can I do so much though, that like you could your mic drop in the mid to late 80s, for any argument was to haul out the starving African child, you don't have to do fuck all to have ever helped anybody in any way apart from your dumb lip service and performative gestures. But like you haul out the starving African child, and all conversation stops otherwise you're a monster

Unknown 11:40
with this is this is like the great Simpsons bit what what someone think of the children what

Unknown 11:44
someone think of the children, Mr. Flanders, and it's a similar kind of thing here. We're like when you're that there's a reason it's called bad faith. There's a kind of bad faith that involves republicans giving democrats advice about what to do in an election. That's a famous kind of bad faith. There's but you know, the classic kind of bad faith is to say, oh, oh, you're you're like you're being a terrible person, because I'm going to do this mic drop thing, or you're being a hypocrite, because what about Islam? There's all that kind of stuff. But the problem is like what we don't, now you're going to get in the weeds about arguing with somebody about whether it's bad faith to bring up fucking concentration. We know what, you know, last week, you did not care about concentration camps. This is don't don't act like you're at the forefront of trying to protect human rights just because you can say, what about concentration camps?

Unknown 12:32
You know what I mean? I have a thought on this, which is I think that the liberals are constantly in search of some sort of rhetorical move, or framework where they don't ever have to have a moral position. And they don't have to do politics, but they can just police. They can just go well, I'm right, because of the rules. Does that

Unknown 12:51
make sense? Oh, they are I think I think they're looking for you see this in trending Twitter topics, which made me want to just tear my dick off and hit myself with it. You see all of this, like all all I really need is the facts that will give me the ultimate sick burn and everything I hate unnecessarily and

Unknown 13:06
it's not even the facts. It's it's because I would say it's like pre fact, it's like a framework by which you will win the argument, don't you agree?

Unknown 13:14
And so but what you're really looking for is the sick burn. That's the thing. If I sick burn, if I sick, burn Donald Trump bad enough, you'll have to leave?

Unknown 13:20
Well, that's a piece of this pathology too. But the thing I'm talking about is different, which is liberals don't want to have an R, they don't want to have an argument where there's a sick burn. They want to preempt the argument by having some sort of framework where you're wrong before the argument happens. And to me,

Unknown 13:35
like they didn't turn in their form, right? They

Unknown 13:37
didn't turn in their form. Right? exact, you know, you're right. You're absolutely right. And to me, a lot

Unknown 13:42
of them qualify for this to pay.

Unknown 13:44
Yeah. And okay, so to me a lot of the the social justice language that's deployed on Twitter, it's supposed to be a sort of pre ideological, pre fact pre sick burn framework by which you can like adjudicate a conflict. And so they would so cultural appropriation, let's use that as an example. Right. The idea is, if someone is doing cultural appropriation you go, stop right there. technical foul, you did not do your paperwork. I'm not going to hear the rest of your argument. You're wrong. You lost by default.

Unknown 14:17
Yeah, you're at you like it, you're out on a technicality. But yeah, the judges issue of defining the calories are important to me.

Unknown 14:23
Now, maybe they were doing cultural appropriation like that. That's where then I just want to say like, anytime you create the rules like that, the rules of the debate that prohibit that, where you you don't have to do politics, you don't have to assert what's right and wrong. You don't even have to get the SEC burn. You're just like, No, I've got a, I dictate the rules of how we're going to talk. And because I've done that, I'm setting the terms of the debate, and you're outside of that. And so I went by default. The right has a very long history of that. See, they don't care about these rules, but they will Co Op them to confuse us.

Unknown 14:55
Oh, hundred hundred percent. That's that's the thing with Trump, Trump's doing so much been in a shit. And we're running from one room to the other filing different kinds of paperwork. And it's like, that's not stopping him. What about fake news? Fake news was our word. We started fake news to criticize the Trump. Do you know where I'm going with this? I think initially, initially, I don't I feel like it wasn't directly Trump. But it had to be well, was it true? It was it was because we were you know, I remember being a liberal, there was a liberal term for for about a month. It was the liberal term for when you would say there was it was actually you know, unfashionable news about Trump that might have come from some kind of a dicey source,

Unknown 15:35
right. Like the like the Pope. The Pope endorses Trump over Hillary was fake news. That was a fabricated news story that was widely I barely remember that. Now. That's so crazy. You're right. It was it was a it was a huge that was a big problem for us. The election will leave in in

Unknown 15:49
fake news became this is the fact that I don't like so it's not true.

Unknown 15:52
Exactly. But But did you see how quickly it was within like three weeks? Like we like had it and it became the thing of like, we we're trying to police the debate by saying, Oh, well, we don't have to assert what's right and wrong, because you're using fake news. And so therefore, we want to, like take that take that, you know, conservatives, but just quickly got flipped on us. If they're like, Oh, I see like this, like they don't care. They don't care about intellectual integrity, internal consistency. They're just like, oh, here's a rule we can exploit cool. It's like It's like, it's like, it's like if you've ever played like d&d with someone who's just a power gamer. And like, you can try to create a framework where they can't power game d&d, but any rule you make, they're just going to, like, use it against it's like Judo, right? They're going to use it your own power against you,

Unknown 16:34
against you your size and your mouth.

Unknown 16:36
They're exploiting loopholes. Like, the more rules you create, the more loopholes that will be anyway, this is all by way of saying like, I just drives me insane. That yesterday, the right was like actually saying concentration camps is cultural appropriation, and it's a bad, anti semitic and bad. And we all were like everyone on Twitter was just sitting there scratching their heads going well, now, I don't know what to do. I guess maybe they're good. Maybe we should be walking these children up.

Unknown 17:01
He makes he makes it. I don't agree with everything he says. But he makes some good points.

Unknown 17:04
Can't you fucking assert it? Isn't there no moral thing? somebody

Unknown 17:10
threw a pile of paperwork over here. And then we chase the paperwork, like,

Unknown 17:14
isn't there anything? Isn't there any foundation just moral foundation that we're willing to argue about? And just

Unknown 17:20
say you need a concentration camp, we need a focus camp.

Unknown 17:26
It's not that I'm busy with the with the forced labor, it's that I'm time constrained by the time constrained. No, but but like, it's like, can't we? How about this? Could we assert that it's wrong to have children in extra judicial prisons without a suspension of rights?

Unknown 17:47
Well, there's there's two answers to that max. One is we don't do that. And second, it's very effective.

Unknown 17:52
It's just it's like, I would rather have the debate of whether it's right or wrong.

Unknown 17:56
Hmm, well, we don't do it, but it's very effective. I think, okay, so I'm tired of all the Trump as baby stuff. Yeah, we all know Trump's a baby. But here's the thing. I feel like America, especially the democrats are running some kind of like figurines store, where there is a child who has somehow gotten his hands on to a mace or a battle axe, and it's like, just literally running through this door, like breaking everything. And we're frantically on the phone, like calling everybody in the phone book to try and find out who the kids parents are. Like, we're like, oh, you're going to be in so much trouble. And it stops nothing. It's nothing that terrible, the shitty fucking performance that he turned in in Orlando last night to kick kick off his campaign that technically began in January of 2017. Where you could just feel like the energy just draining from the room and and you just know that in that moment, that guy will just say and do anything. Fuck it. I give up. I quit. I quit everything. I'm done. I'm done. So

Unknown 18:55
Chris Hayes yesterday says last comment on this concentration camp is an extremely charged term and I get why many people are in good faith uncomfortable with its application for Godwin's law purposes, among others. So let's just call them detention camps and focus on what's happening in them. Thank you. Thanks, Chris. That's very helpful. To which Mike Godwin, the historian who coined the term Godwin's law says Chris, I think their concentration camp

Unknown 19:20
they're going to receive his golden necktie award. For fuck sake. What is wrong

Unknown 19:25
with

Unknown 19:26
you are now the president of necktie Twitter.

Unknown 19:29
We're so far Where do you think we're so

Unknown 19:30
oh my god, your tweet about the fucking? What was it text bad boy?

Unknown 19:39
wallpaper

Unknown 19:39
from the DNC.

Unknown 19:45
Tell me what this was. So before you before your response, please describe what did you quote tweet it? Okay.

Unknown 19:51
Let me I'm trying, I have to make a decision. Now. I'm having a real Robert Frost thing of how much t Am I going to spill? Well, the Whoa, I don't care, whatever. Well, I that was still room I have at various times in my life, I have been involved in the email operation for the Democratic Party. And I have some knowledge, institutional knowledge of like, what works and what doesn't work to like, make money off of email lists. And like, keep a subscriber base. Are you

Unknown 20:19
thinking about the thing you just said for a while? I'm sorry, I want to hear this. But I gotta do a Robert Frost thing, or I decide how much t to spill. That's something I would say that makes no fucking sense. It probably does. I'm going to think about that for a real long time. Nothing. Gold

Unknown 20:31
stays. All right. Well, I'm trying to I'm trying to spell it rains, rain hands small. I'm just trying to spill the tea.

Unknown 20:40
So I

Unknown 20:41
have run email operations for four don't say which party, you've been involved with a political party that people have heard of, let's just leave it at that.

Unknown 20:49
That's been a job. It's been a job. I'd have to manage fundraising email with some for big campaigns and things like that. And I'm on the DNC in the D Triple C email list, and they're quite bad. And during the midterms, I was working on a number of midterm campaigns, and I was following all the D Triple C emails. And you know, I got an email. They were really bad. I mean, really, really bad last time and widely mocked on Twitter. And the one that finally sort of broke my spirit was they sent one out that said, Mueller fired exclamation point. And then when you open it up, it said, this is the headline that you might see if mitch mcconnell gets his way. Click here to give $10 if you don't want this to happen, give $10 to dinner because

Unknown 21:28
they're trolling. They're trolling grandpa's. Yeah, it's pretty. It's not a trolling grandpa kind of thing to do. I don't know.

Unknown 21:35
I mean, I think what happens is, I think it's a little bit like the wire, where they're drinking the stats, they're doing the numbers, you know, so that they're basically someone's job.

Unknown 21:44
They're changing the change in the way that it's quantified. So it looks like you're reducing crime in the case of

Unknown 21:49
correct right there. There. It's a little calm stat in that email room. And someone at the top is going we need more PO,

Unknown 21:55
they're increasing their open rate correct. Someone at the top is going ok, I see what we got a

Unknown 21:59
week got a juice that open rate and all the people down. But uh, no one is saying, we have to make this list be really high integrity, so that we can see

Unknown 22:06
excellence. Like john Syracuse's says the XY problem, you should have told me what you actually wanted to accomplish, right? You're gonna you're gonna, this intern is going to get, I don't know, get a tote bag if they're able to increase the open rate, right? But like, do we want do we want anybody to fundamentally change the way they think about this campaign? And

Unknown 22:21
what we really want, what we want people to is for people to actually open these emails and trust them and do what they say so that we can win elections and get house candidates elected. But you know, I think what happened was they probably had some sort of edict where it's like you said, open rate, and then they had to do you know, stupid headlines, I'm just guessing I wasn't there. But anyway. So and the other problem is the D, Triple C in particular has very high turnover. And it tends to sort of flip every two to four years with almost a completely new staff. So I don't really know anyone working on this, and they don't really, they're not really good at retaining any institutional knowledge. So all the stuff that I learned is just and all the people after me, it's just out the window, and some new people come in, and they think they haven't been get out. So anyway, I got very concerned after Mueller fired, and I, me, and well, we'll edit this out if I can't say no, me and Laura Rowland, who is the email director for Hillary 2016. And a few other people I believe, reached out to the D, Triple C and said, Hey, guys, we have some expertise in this domain. And I really think these emails are hurting the long term viability of this list. And we really will need this in the next presidential cycle. And could you not could we meet with you and give you some free advice? And just give us you know, we hear us out and we'll make our case of how to fix this.

Unknown 23:32
Okay, so the in doing that, so if I'm hearing you correctly, we say we're going to need this list. There is a benefit a potential benefit to the engagement and to getting people to donate. But also just engagement. The risk you run is they unsubscribe and then you can't

Unknown 23:50
Merlin Are you are you familiar with the tail The Boy Who Cried Wolf?

Unknown 23:54
Hmm, I feel like I am is that Robert Frost? Nothing gold state nothing gold can say that.

Unknown 23:58
Yeah, everything everything that glitters isn't gold.

Unknown 24:02
Okay, okay. Say gold pony boy. Yeah, it's what you're saying. Yeah. So this is what I mean. I'm asking the right question here. Like you don't want those folks to bolt and unsubscribe because now you don't have their stuff you can use them when you really need

Unknown 24:13
How many times can you say molar fired and trick people in opening the email before they go? Boy, I better open all the daily email from the deeper Triple C tomorrow to see what it is like at some point you know, you're you're just people will stop opening those emails like that, you know, I get it that that someone is doing good job but using that number and that that day, they were good boy, and they got they got a big number of opens. But like, what about tomorrow? Like, that's what I'm thinking about is like this is this is why we don't hold like any real political power in in this country. Anyhow, all this aside anyway. So we emailed the D triple

Unknown 24:44
it's a long term game, you're not going to worry too much about endgame strategy and survivor in the first episode, because then you get pegged as that guy and you know, you're fucking out in two episodes.

Unknown 24:53
Well, if you listen, I'm saying

if you orchestrate a big blindside, everyone's gonna come back on you the next week, because they don't trust you. You said you've given up your trustworthiness ever but you can never buy that back. So we asked the D Triple C to me and we were like hey, we don't want any money we don't want anything we'll just have a meeting will give you our take and you can listen to us and you know whatever. And they were like, We don't want to meet with you. We don't need to know anything that you have to say everything is great. We're doing exactly what we want and furthermore working we're worried if we meet with you that you'll just like say bad things about us on Twitter and like you're just you setting us up to like make fun of us. It was it was so paranoid and so fucking crazy.

Unknown 25:34
I think it is I don't care. Oh, I don't care i'm not gonna I'm not I've already

Unknown 25:38
I'm already just add up to 20 seconds of beeps at a time Do you know

Unknown 25:41
the other thing that D Triple C did? That's really crazy as they said

Unknown 25:45
because he just did the thing they were worried you do?

Unknown 25:47
I suppose I did. But they didn't Yeah, me so I don't listen. I think he did you drag the max are they canceled? Their canceled? The D Triple C has already said if you work for if you challenge if you work for a candidate that's challenging and incumbent Democrat. You're You're blacklisted. And so I'm glad I'm fucking blacklisted. I'm gonna work for Marie Newman for Congress. We said we say African American listed now. Yeah, crisscross applesauce. But I'm I'm like, I'm like, like, you know, fucking Daniel Pinsky is like basically a Republican, but he's just runs as a Democrat in Illinois. And he's got to get these these not pro choice, but he's got to get the fuck out of there. So what good is it doesn't do us any good to have them in the party. So if I'm going to be blacklisted, so be it like that. might as well make fun of them on my medium sized podcast.

Unknown 26:30
Yeah, yeah, your large adult pod. But

Unknown 26:31
anyway, so the D Triple C so clearly, they've taken what I've had to say to heart and they tweeted out this is at the Democrats. So they tweeted a picture. And it's a it's a black picture with with an iPhone, like four on it. And and it's got a wallpaper that's it's not even a wallpaper. It's like a little square Instagram, like, it looks like dog shit. Like you couldn't ever use this as your wallpaper. Because like Alex would have an aneurysm if she saw this because it's like, you're I mean, it's a little a square aspect ratio, like it doesn't fill your background, it looks bad. And it says it's a picture of Trump from the nose down. So it's his sort of like grimacing like bottom tier. And it just says, boy by 2020 democrats.org, and then the logo for the Democratic Party, lots of text, you know, classically the thing you want on your phone background, and then it says get and then on the picture, it says Get Your FREE, limited edition boy by phone wallpaper, text quote, boy by unquote 243367 to get yours today. And then on the bottom it says by signing up

Unknown 27:37
it looks like the warnings on a pack of cigarettes.

Unknown 30:05
overwhelming. It's like, how are you? I need the other code for on top of this code.

Unknown 30:09
How are you supposed to do anything? Are you supposed to fucking go to the grocery store and get tomato paste it when there's concentration camps, like it's so it's like,

Unknown 30:17
I probably shouldn't be a girl from Ipanema play.

Unknown 30:20
I shouldn't be affected by it this much. But like it's so hard. It's such a fucking dark cloud over everything. Like all food tastes a little less sweet. And all jokes are a little less funny. Like, everything is a little worse.

Unknown 30:33
I can't I can't go totally to sleep. I sleep with one eye open like Metallica says

Unknown 30:40
just fuck try. I can't believe how miserable Trump is making me

Unknown 30:44
Oh, no, no, it's horrible. Or am I maybe

Unknown 30:46
I'm already maybe I'm always this miserable. And I'm just sort of projecting. It's just like I'm

Unknown 30:50
getting health condition. I think my organs are moving.

Unknown 30:52
And something's not something has changed. You've

Unknown 30:54
got a wandering. You've got a wandering uterus you want to train.

Unknown 30:58
I love that Sarah McLachlan song. Is that what it's called?

Unknown 31:04
Is uh, you know what? I fucking hate. Is this an open thread? This is an open thread, right?

Unknown 31:09
Yeah.

Unknown 31:10
Okay, OT do good. You know what I fucking hate on nevermind, I you know what? I hate? Max. My organs are moving. Don't What do you expect of me? I have a lot of problems. You know what I hate? I hate every tweet that ends with then you aren't paying attention.

Unknown 31:24
Yeah. Boy, I hate that.

Unknown 31:27
Well, if this news about the concentration camp is something surprising, then you haven't been paying attention?

Unknown 31:32
Fuck you. Fuck you.

Unknown 31:34
I know. I know. I know. You're gonna make fun of me for saying this. I really have cut my Twitter consumption down by over 90% I mean, I'm so intrigued on

Unknown 31:43
the website. I should have said that's the thing. That tweet is the thing where it's like a capsule of word, word bomb words.

Unknown 31:49
What is words? Well, language is a game that we're all enacting together

Unknown 31:53
with our words to OI let

Unknown 31:55
we're in it. But we're also have it

Unknown 31:57
have it? Yes.

Unknown 31:59
No, I just, it's it's a real I'm telling you. Like, I know maybe you've already come to this through your own sort of leading Twitter for a while. But it's a real emperor has no clothes situation. Like I used to get so worked up about this stuff. And I'd be so feel like this was where it was happening. And it was like the thing and like, I still feel like I do show I'm like, oh my god. It's just, it's like, it's one of those things where it's like, well, it's like the, if you close your eyes, the whole world really does go away. Like if you just don't look at it has no power over you. Yes, it's crazy. It's so it doesn't matter. It doesn't affect anything.

Unknown 32:32
I felt and I said this before, I don't care. I'm gonna say it again, this is something that I came to realize, in the days where I thought a lot and wrote a lot about stuff like email. And like that. Here's the thing, like, when you are in a very keyed up state, you can't stop checking your email. And for a lot of people, and I'm not, I'm just going to own the privilege and say that depends a lot on your job. There are people who have to do that kind of stuff all day. But you need to stand over that email all day. Wow, is that ever can be a terrible feeling. It makes you feel like your organs are moving.

Unknown 33:02
You're saying some some people have a job, where they might have some important they haven't used their email for work, they might hear some news about the Yamamoto deal.

Unknown 33:11
Oh, yeah, sure, you gotta get the Henderson report out. But like, you know, back in the day, when you couldn't just get email everywhere, I would always feel this was the wildest thing where I couldn't be around email, a lot, like on vacation, and then you come back, and you're like, it's amazing how much this kind of sorted itself out. And if I had been there, I don't know how much I would have contributed to any of this. And the same thing happens, especially on political Twitter, our beloved political Twitter lists, and sometimes there were if you step away from that shit, like, I've been doing some hobby things with my kid, and we've been having a lot of like, you know, family adventure times, and like going places and doing little little things, you know, bikes and stuff. And like, I'm away from Twitter for you know, whatever, three hours, fucking five hours, I don't know. And then I come back, and oh, like, everything, everything is everything. And people are just fucking losing it. And I'm like, we, what, what, what is what? Like, what am I looking at here? I come back. And I'm like, this is what I missed. What I missed is you guys taking this as the opportunity, something weird happened, and it's your opportunity to retweet your Washington Post article from two years ago. And like, that's what I missed. I didn't miss that much. And like some of the shit that was bad worked itself out. Some of the stuff didn't and I would not have changed anything about it by looking at it. While it was happening or not happening. I was painting Dungeons and Dragons figures with my daughter. And I'm so glad I did that listening to the adventure zone. I'm so glad I did that. Instead of laying on my bed with this thing. nine inches from my fucking face scrolling by for seven hours. So you are absolutely correct. I totally feel you

Unknown 34:40
Do you ever have one of those? This is maybe is under the category of private mind motion. But I had this thing where I was like driving somewhere the other day. And I just I think the deal was I just tapped into at that moment. I just didn't have any music or podcast on I was just sort of thinking, which is rare. I usually have something going on in the car. Or usually I'm tweeting and I'm listening podcast while I'm driving.

Unknown 35:03
I'm good at but I'm good. I'm good at it

Unknown 35:05
though. You don't have beast mode on to you.

Unknown 35:07
Oh, absolutely. But I'm good. I'm good at tweeting and driving because I've done my

Unknown 35:12
heart goes so fast. Max, what are you doing? You if you get upset and accidentally hit the bell you're gonna hear what

Unknown 35:19
you know. It's it's that I have 10 Malcolm Gladwell. 10,000 hours like I'm Oh,

Unknown 35:23
that's right. You're like, yeah, you played all those hours in, in, in Hamburg.

Unknown 35:27
Yeah, I'm already an expert at tweeting and driving. Don't Don't, don't message me. But anyway, he won't receive nobody. I didn't, I wasn't doing anything. And I had this moment of like, mindfulness just come like crashing down on me. And I was like, and I was like, man, like, like, I don't what was the I was like, I was thinking like, this is so crazy. Like, I've been down the street 100 times. And I've never I've just done I've never actually been present in this situation. And like, looked around and like seen all the stuff here. And then I started thinking like, how many days do I go, I wake up and I I go through the entire day. And I go to sleep and I'm not really attentive to anything, like I don't really see any of the moments, or any of the streets. And if I were to think back on that day, I mean, what is a day other like in your life, other than something you can look back on. And remember, it's like a little story that you have for yourself. And that's, that's maybe what you would call like, a well lived life. You know, it's just having lots of those memories of good moments and good days.

Unknown 36:22
I'm like, and like nothing sounds fluffy, but like having having been there and having been present for what was happening while you were there. Which sounds It sounds so obvious. And so like yoga mat, but like that's so fucking true. Like, I spent so much of my day slightly to completely tuned out from my environment. Yeah.

Unknown 36:39
And how many days of my like, probably years have I like not had a moment where I was just like, Damn, I'm like, right here in this situation. And and here's a little moment, like, weirdly, I'll remember that minute sitting in my car in traffic, probably more than I'll remember the entire week that preceded it where I'm sure I did some cool shit and hung out with people or something. It's just a weird it's one of those weird things of the way you like process. But I was thinking like, there is there like like, you know, what reminded me of this was when you were saying you can work yourself when you're like, on your phone and you're like refreshing email, nothing that refresh Twitter, nothing there, refresh Instagram, nothing there refer and then you get into a loop.

Unknown 37:14
So suddenly, you're like four inches away from a panic attack for absolutely no, yeah,

Unknown 37:18
you just you sort of you sort of spool yourself up, you're like, you're like, here we go. Let's let's get all wound up. And yes, you can really work yourself to a mania. And I think it has this effect of chopping every moment up into 500 micro moments that that string your along from this to this to this to this to this in a way where you you're not that then that's it, and then you go to bed. And that's your day. Good work.

Unknown 37:40
Yes. And I have to have two things to say about this. Um, first of all, I've mentioned this before, but something that I have, I'm not good at this, but Boy, am I ever fucking aware of this. And I and this, a lot of this has come from like trying to deal with my anxiety. And there's this one book I like about anxiety, etc, etc. which is that stopping the noise in your head,

Unknown 38:00
stopping the noise in your head,

Unknown 38:02
huh? Yeah, and the basic idea is that there's signals and there's noise. And people with anxiety, and especially people with OCD, it's virtually impossible for them distinguish to distinguish signal from noise. And in fact, they can actually kind of generate their own noise. And so you learn to like not worry about your content or a signal. And in this case, he calls your content, the content is the thing that makes you like think, Oh, definitely the iron on or whatever. And it's like basically having you you deal you confront the the anxiety, rather than the thing that causes the anxiety because otherwise is that's how they

Unknown 38:35
I bought this almost exactly a year ago, I assumed you wonder why as you told me earlier, but you know, it was

Unknown 38:41
in the point is in those so point number one, in reading that book and thinking about this a lot, there is something I discovered, I discovered this with my sleep shit, I discovered this with my anxiety, shit. And this is going to sound not very profound, but it actually has huge implications, which is that like, let's say, so let the classic example let's say you suddenly realize you're being you know, chased by a tiger, whatever the whatever the classic example is, and a lot of stuff happens with your body. So your pulse starts racing, you release adrenaline, you might shoot yourself, like all this stuff that happens when there's this legit fear in front of you. causes your I think, you know, I think you could say, autonomic system, your limbic system to really kick into gear and do all of this stuff, which makes a ton of sense. But here's the thing, like, when you are an anxious person, you, you will find yourself not even realizing the physical symptoms that you are having, until it's probably too late. I'm not putting the super well. But here's the problem. It isn't that like I just discovered there, there is a tiger or might be a tiger, it's that my heart is really, really racing. And I'm getting all these signals that are now telling my brain how I should be thinking and how I should be behaving, right, the cognitive and behavioral, the emotional, all of those things are coming out of this physical activity. So when we say that here, you can fucking keyed up looking at fucking Twitter, and you get off, and you get all the apps in the app switch, and you're going around, you're doing all this. And like, pretty soon, your body is wracked with all of these not deadly, but really important cues to your body, that bad shit is happening. How would you feel any way other than terrible, you know, like, like the damn Benjamin used to say you're, you're a guy in a room, you're fucking sitting in a room in a chair, or like a nice car, or like a podcast studio, you're in this environment where there is not actually an imminent danger to you, right? That second, right. And yet, your body is sending you all of these cues that go straight into your limbic system, your amygdala, like all this shit is going on, that is causing your body to now say, Oh, I guess I gotta go make more anxious juice. You know what I mean? But like, you don't stop to go like, well, what if I dealt with these physical symptoms first, like, what if I said, I try and get my heart rate down, I try and control my breathing a little bit, all that kind of stuff. And then the other stuff kind of falls in line, you take a minute, you just fucking chill out for a minute. Like the the phrase that this guy uses in this book that I like is when you start feeling the is it welling up, you acknowledge it by saying, Oh, I'm doing that thing again, or something like that. Or here that here comes this thing again. And then if it is, you could say to yourself, you know what, this is good. This is difficult, but I can handle this. Like you just kind of self talk, but you just deal with the fact that like, the problem is how much of the time do you walk around? Like if you stop for one second? I'm screaming into a microphone about self help right now. I don't even know what my heartbeat is. I should probably check. How often do we stop and go like, why don't I just chill the fuck out for a minute. What the What am I doing to myself? I'm going to address this by opening more tabs.

Unknown 41:31
That's mental

Unknown 41:32
Well, okay, I have a little I

Unknown 41:34
do have a two but go ahead.

Unknown 41:36
I have a little half baked but

Unknown 41:41
you can pick a day it's not delivery. It's the Jordan

Unknown 41:43
really throw this out on the stoop and see if the cat likes it up.

Unknown 41:46
All right, uh, let's let's show the flagpole and see if anybody if salutes

Unknown 41:55
hope Alice comes back soon. This is not good. No, this is this is a as important and as important. As we say, this is not a good one.

Unknown 42:17
Here's my thing. I think people have I think about this a lot. I think people have the human mind has an amazing capacity to like, how do I put it to like feel a certain way. And then sort of like back solve into why they're feeling that way. But for the wrong reason. Let so so let me give you an example. Hundred percent like so maybe to use the concentrate, if I can use the concentration camps thing as an example, like reading these news articles or whatever makes me feel extremely anxious. I feel very small. I feel like out of control. I feel very powerless. Like I it makes me feel just for me personally, those are like some of my worst feelings like that, that, you know, some horrible thing happened to someone and I am powerless to do anything. It really it makes me feel like I get like, enraged like I feel very like red and like hot. But also just like it's very scary. Like I hate it. I hate feeling that way. And so there's some way I think but I can't really so but the core thing in some ways is the helplessness the little bit of panic, but it's it's helpless. Yes. And and rage and and and it's and and I don't want to be feeling like that. And there's not really anything I can do about it other than address it within myself. And I don't think there's much more I can be doing to sort of like about, you know, these, whatever concentration camps or whatever is making me mad. But there is a weird way where like, what I'll do when I get into that state is go on Twitter and get in fights with people and tell people to, you know, log off. Suck my balls. And and it's a weird way of I can then I have a little story I tell myself of like, it's not that I'm feeling these ways because of something that is it's a way of making money. It's like, it's like no, I'm really mad about these. morons on Twitter. Like it's mad. I'm mad about something that I can control. Like I'm cheating. You know what I mean? It's like, absolutely, it's a it's a defense mechanism because it's like it's like it's so scary

Unknown 44:10
to think about the alcohol the alcoholic dad who hates his job that ends up hating the kid right? He's not actually mad at the kid is the kid is what he can control. He hates his boss and he hates his choices.

Unknown 44:20
I have to say I think there's a similar cycle you know, I've been punishing myself since the election by just like read all this this you know, whatever.

Unknown 44:29
Bullshit with the Jewish go back on my bullshit.

Unknown 44:32
And I'll say like,

Unknown 44:34
Eric will be nice, but

Unknown 44:36
there's a thing where just you it's not always that people are completely dehumanized. And then they're like, oh, they're, they're insects. And so we'll put them in concentration camps. It sometimes it's the other way around. Sometimes you put people into concentration camps, and you treat them poorly. And you've people the public feels such cognitive dissonance. They go well, we wouldn't do this if they were people so they might have to have done something we had a after we've done some things,

Unknown 45:00
people watching cops. It's like there's that whole podcast now about about the history of cops. And it's like, that's formed our idea about how policing should and does work. And all those people are fucking guilty maniacs.

Unknown 45:11
Yeah, but but also, but like, but there's this idea of like, well, if they're there, they must be less than human because we wouldn't put them there if they were fully human. And that creates what Hannah a rant called the environment in which anything is possible. And that's where you really

Unknown 45:25
get never get into like the hyper. What's this? What's that movie? It's kind of like that.

Unknown 45:30
Well, that's where you get the some Dr. Mengele shit.

Unknown 45:34
Huh. Know what, so which,

Unknown 45:36
coincidentally, also we are we're doing to people in these camps. Oh, God, what's the what's the movie? I'm hyper normalization?

Unknown 45:43
Yeah, yeah. Part of it is like you're not you're not sure you're not sure what's real?

Unknown 45:48
Yes. Always? Yes.

Unknown 45:52
Pretty cool. And number two, number two was about there's the anxiety thing, and I had a really good number two. That's why we started late.

Unknown 46:01
Sorry, I throw you off, Merlin. No, no, no, no,

Unknown 46:04
no, no, no, I threw me off. That's what I do I do that. No, no, no, I think it was. But it was just it was having to do with that. I guess it was just this moment the other day when I was walking down the steps and getting ready to go out. And I was in the area of our house that I called the kill zone. And the kill zone is the area right by our door, where I'm pretty sure what we're all going to die. Because that's where all the children's shoes are in. And sometimes there's a bag that won't let the door open completely. And as even as recently as this morning, I call it the kill zone. And sometimes when I'm walking through the kill zone, you know, to leave the house, I'll be thinking and i was i was i was getting ready to go down. I was going downstairs. And I just I suddenly just like I guess just it dawned on me how many things were kind of on my mind. Because I'm in a very fretful state of like a lot of the time.

Unknown 46:53
Do you ever get so much that what as you go to write something down in your to do list something else pops into your head and you start writing that down on the new kit? Remember the first thing you went to open your to do list to write down? What do you think what do you think

Unknown 47:06
I still I still have a page in a mole skin that just says got Jeff Goldblum.

Unknown 47:09
Get that all the time of like, I came into this room and I can't remember why I'm staring I'm staring at me focused on like, why did I have this open?

Unknown 47:18
I just want to know the steps to getting ready to go through the kill zone and I so I had on my backpack. That's where the children's shoes are. I'm gonna die there for sure. And I always say to my daughter, I said, be careful because remember, the door wants to kill you, the door will be part of the calculation. Because the door when it is open, then the door closes very, very slowly. And the thing is you will break your nose on the door, but it really wants to kill you,

Unknown 47:41
Merlin, if you die, you break your head open on the door and Alex is gone. Then the podcast is going to be me yelling at chris hayes

Unknown 47:48
about about a website. I don't use anymore.

Unknown 47:56
Our nine out of you smoking a cigarette,

Unknown 47:59
my survivor draft pool and you telling Chris to Suck my balls.

Unknown 48:17
doesn't fucking matter. But I'll just

Unknown 48:18
while I was walking down the steps get ready to move through the kill zone. And I'm thinking about what I what I'm thinking a little bit about what I'm doing. I'm thinking about what I need to do. Of course, I'm thinking about what I've done. I'm thinking about what I haven't done. I just had this like going back to you and you're tweeting in your car where I had this kind of like in a slight just very, very brief moment of clarity that I kind of imprinted on. And it was just it was just it was just so weird because like I was walking down the steps going to the kill zone I got my backpack on. I'm going to eventually go downstairs so I need to open the garage door. I need to get my scoot scoot. Is there anything I forgot because you know what I always say I always say if you think you forgot something you probably did. So I'm thinking about that. Thinking about how I got to do pick up at this particular time thinking about the myriad tasks that I need to do to just keep I have to spend so many goddamn plates just to keep toilet paper in the house at all. I'm thinking about my my role I like job I like to call the Night Manager which is like if mom has gone to bed at a decent hour I am a little later Now I'm doing the management of like what how much video we're allowed to watch for this long and do we get a second then I'm coming self The Night Manager and last night my wife was tired. And we were just watching project project dressed top dress and I said don't worry the name managers got it the knock from aka or whatever. Anyway, I don't know. Um, but I just had this kind of this this moment where I was like, Wow, my brain is in so many places that are not on the steps walking through the kill zone right now. It's so fucking manic that I just kind of caught myself and again, I want to be clear for once in my life. I was not listening to a podcast. I did have everything in my pockets. But do you ever had the feeling like you're I'm running through this array of shit? Like I'm looking at some kind? Like Awesome, awesome Monday is like 1 million TV sets with my pet Tiger like trying to figure out what the fuck is happening in my life. And I'm thinking about the kill zone and I'm thinking about the Segway and I'm thinking about did we get the right guy because we accidentally bought the kind of paper towels that aren't just half size but they can be quarter sized who wants that? you rip it off and you get a quarter of a sheets to small slice getting the vivas I famously the my usual reorder they had to replace they said Mr. Man, we replacing this with these new ones. You can have a smaller so I

Unknown 50:33
got an instacart Let me tell you, I'm almost I'm almost instacart is almost canceled. I ordered one head of garlic on instacart. And they brought you pay for what? No, no, no, I ordered $50 of groceries. But one of the items was I asked her please bring me one head of garlic. And they brought me instead a bag of pre peeled garlic.

Unknown 50:56
Oh, that's not what you wanted. Yeah, that

Unknown 50:58
that gets your cue sounds good. Syracuse on the phone. I can't work with that.

Unknown 51:01
If I ever told you. One time I ordered number four coffee filters and they were out. So they brought me two boxes of number two coffee filters. My hand to God.

Unknown 51:11
You know what? I would have done the same thing in math. That's why do you smell like weed?

Unknown 51:16
Two times two

Unknown 51:18
is

Unknown 51:18
so funny

Unknown 51:20
garlic. And so all I wanted to say is that I had it wasn't a moment of clarity. It was a moment of shame as I walked to the kill zone and I'm thinking about the two small slice and I'm thinking about the pickup and did she wear the right shoes to be able to walk home today like we had planned? And is anybody going to reschedule anything because it's silly season I'm thinking about all the things and I just I just had that feeling of like fucking like Jesus. No wonder it feels like my organs are moving. Donald Trump is president and I'm thinking about everything except what I'm doing right now. And it was a terrible feeling. Yeah, I'm sorry. Now it sounds like I'm getting back to work on myself again. But no, it was it was a terrible feeling. I'm like just fucking fucking calm down like like Taylor Swift. Cox you need to calm down. Yeah. Yeah,

Unknown 51:59
I get that I walk around look like usually I like to be doing no less than six things so I'll be have a podcast on this of course you do. That's that's how you keep up the demon dog. Yeah, yeah. I usually like to have a podcast on speaker phone of my of my iPhone. And then maybe I'm texting someone and writing down to do items and things. And then I'm practicing a coin trick of my other hand usually

Unknown 52:19
sound like Shiva. You've got multiple,

Unknown 52:23
and then I'm like skateboarding to work.

Unknown 52:25
That's a cool luck. Yeah. Anyway, we need to calm the fuck down.

Unknown 52:30
That the show are we done? Can we go? What? I guess we gotta do Garfield.

Unknown 52:34
Oh, we don't have to do Garfield. We should do what can we do? We got Garfield. No escape, Garfield. And do you want to because we got to do the show to

Unknown 52:45
beer after show.

Unknown 52:47
Now, Max, Max. Come on. We gotta do this thing. I'm gonna do the challenge.

Unknown 52:53
Oh, yeah. You do it? Well, I picked a challenge that I could do right now. And I'm I can just pull up on my wall Instagram here,

Unknown 53:00
kinda was so pumped to hear what Alex was gonna say. Let's see, like anything else to talk to her about her.

Unknown 53:05
Hers would have been pretty, pretty funny.

Unknown 53:07
TTO I sent you a video that I as I mentioned in my my private text to you. I said PR what you're talking about right now. And it's a CGP grey video called UR. And it demonstrates Fuck, I don't know what it's called. But like, he got the two brains. And the way that perception works is so bananas. And they talk he talking about these experiments where, you know, people are your left hand doesn't basically doesn't know what your right hand is doing. No, it's a really good video. But the thing that he says in here that I think about a lot and I've heard this other places. But the thing I think about a lot is that so much human behavior involves doing something. And then if needed later on coming up with the reason why you did it. And it happens all the time with people. It's like if you ask somebody why they did something very few people, unless they're deliberately trying to cover something up will say Oh, no reason. Lots of people just do shit. But like, what, what are motivate what are what our motivations are for doing practically everything are so muddy and weird. Like, why did you yell at that guy? Is it because Donald Trump made my organs move? No, but he was mean to me online, you know? And it's like, anyway, I'll put this in show notes. It's a good video. You are too and it's one of those. This is one of those ones like the Star Trek transporter one that like you end up thinking about for a real long time. Have you seen the trek the transporter one? Probably?

Unknown 54:28
Okay, on your Instagram profile, tap the

Unknown 54:30
Settings? Oh, no, you're literally doing it now and click on

Unknown 54:35
it got it. Okay. challenge to get into good. All right. Well, as you know, on do by Friday, we like to do a little challenge every week, you know, just to really keep the keep the Gremlins at bay, you know, just just get them right off those airplane wings. And just also something to think about other than

Unknown 54:52
that, because we don't have enough to think about having to

Unknown 54:54
flee the country. And when's the right time? And should I?

Unknown 55:00
Like, well, what country would you even flee to that would sort of be free of climate disaster and political turmoil? I mean, maybe somewhere in Central America? I don't know. Nothing about that all the time. But anyhow, um, I don't know. If you do know, you know, reach out, you know, let me know where to go. Where should we go? Like,

Unknown 55:17
like it pick a nice like a Paul Manafort country, like, you know, Paul Manafort is eventually going to disappear and go somewhere, you know, he's gonna disappear from jail and just go somewhere.

Unknown 55:24
He'll be one of those little villages in Argentina.

Unknown 55:27
Maybe they'll be like a Pappy on or maybe like a Silence of the Lambs. You know, like in Silence of the Lambs at the end when he calls Clarice on the phone.

Unknown 55:33
What about rural What about like West Virginia? Like it like the you know, somewhere in like, the Shenandoah, cuz like, you kind of nice kind of be off the grid. Do you think they'd find you? I didn't want you think they'd find you in the Shenandoah.

Unknown 55:47
Coming through the ride?

Unknown 55:48
Yeah. Do you think do you think running around the Jews up? Do you think that I'll do you think I'll say, Take me to I'm Jewish. And you know, you know, I'll do a you know, one of the them. Heroes, you know, things are wrong. I'd be like,

Unknown 56:01
Oh, we be here later. You're like, I was

Unknown 56:03
wondering why don't more people just go there? Like, are you Jewish? Like, no,

Unknown 56:08
I just say I'm not going Forget it.

Unknown 56:13
I got a podcaster record. I can

Unknown 56:16
pump the brakes, pump the brakes. Like why?

Unknown 56:18
You know what I mean? I do I do a funny card company. I let go into your camp. You call that a concentration camp? That's not a concentration.

Unknown 56:23
Like maybe it's cowardice, but you think more people would just go there go. You know, if you're, if you're a Jew, you have to wear this star you feel like not a Jew.

Unknown 56:32
But can you also just say I'm not that into it?

Unknown 56:35
Well, that's a good question. I gotta bounce.

Unknown 56:39
Sorry, man. Get to your star. Gotta go.

Unknown 56:41
Yeah, I don't know. Maybe it's one of those.

Unknown 56:43
You say I'm not not a Jew. I'm not a Jew. I'm afraid you

Unknown 56:46
know, you just I'm not a Jew or you just be like, I guess I'd be like, No, I'm a Christian.

Unknown 56:50
Oh, but then once they give you a quiz, like like in World War Two, they ask you who plays for the Yankees? That kind of thing.

Unknown 56:55
How hard could it be? I'd be like, I love Wheat Thins and I listened to pod.

Unknown 57:00
That's a really good. So you would just say I would prefer jello into skits. Thank you very much.

Unknown 57:06
I could probably I could probably have a few bars of a creed song. How hard could that be?

Unknown 57:20

Unknown 59:23
No, no, I don't know what it is today. I think it's because Alex is in here. We're super depressed.

Unknown 59:27
I think we're I think we're a little I'm a little worried that I don't know where Alex is. I worry. Oh, you know she'll be fine. She says

Unknown 59:34
you know she's like she's like the Lord. She'll turn up when she's needed.

Unknown 59:37
Yeah, okay, well anyway, you can go

Unknown 59:40
to challenge this week was Max's channel,

Unknown 59:42
you can go to give us your money. com it's going to help us fund the search and rescue me begging for you to tell me it's got vitamins in

Unknown 59:48
it or just regular No, no, no, no, it's classic care about gold there.

Unknown 59:51
You know if you eat too many of those go shit. Really?

Unknown 59:55
Yeah, Google it. I forget to cure that already. But no, you know what I know you'll get you'll get diarrhea if you eat too many. Does this have horses? Um,

Unknown 1:00:04
I don't know if it's that or something else. Can one of the interns look up gummy bear diarrhea and just find out what is it? Is it the gelatin or something? Well, they're both Alex isn't here. They're both sitting here. We have a little gift for your browser. They're both fucking plants nude on their computers back here. I don't know what's going on.

Unknown 1:00:25
Yeah, do some work someone someone look up gummy bear diarrhea. Make it

Unknown 1:00:31
great for when you're on a plane, I would get these one of my point.

Unknown 1:00:34
You just eat the whole bag and shit and shit your pants. Anyway, as I give us your fucking money. com he goes $5 you become a member of Dubai Friday. And now what's the best part is you'll find out the challenge the week before so you can do it with us. And when we talk about it, you'll you'll know what the hell we're talking about. So this week was my challenge. And I thought that because we live in a surveillance state where they track you know, if you're Jewish and how Jewish you are. And if you should go to the camps and when and what in, you know, with your family or without or if you pick one of your children or I don't know, I assume that's where they keep that on Facebook.

Unknown 1:01:06
Yo, they're not they're not jailing the children they're protecting them know what's for their own good.

Unknown 1:01:12
Yeah, they could do a voluntary deportation

Unknown 1:01:15
you can call it a self was called self deport a

Unknown 1:01:18
thing is it's not it. The thing is people are the other argument is well, the right goes well, they've they cross the border illegally. So it is a crime. So it's not a concentration camp, because the only people if you could only be a concentration camp if they were there without breaking the law. But let me remind you crossing the border to seek asylum is not a crime. Most of the most of

Unknown 1:01:36
them again, in the United States is a stand your ground state. Right. So you know, I'm saying

Unknown 1:01:43
right, well, it could be ex post facto.

Unknown 1:01:46
No, sorry. Got quid pro quo. Okay.

Unknown 1:01:48
All right. All right. All right. So right. Yeah.

Unknown 1:01:50
So so just we got you wanted us to go into wherever we could find it.

Unknown 1:01:55
socials. Yeah, right. That's what you gotta do this. This is the job. Yeah, no, i'm doing i'm doing i'm i'm there. I'm not thinking I

Unknown 1:02:01
hate this too. I hate all

Unknown 1:02:03
good. I'm not thinking about anything else. Anyway, um, you know, it's really cool that we have this, that all these companies have this info on you and I thought that it might be a good goof. If we went on and found out you know, that when you use Instagram or whatever they are Facebook or any of these things, Twitter, they sort of try to compile a little picture of you a little a little love a little vignette of you in a

Unknown 1:02:23
laboratory

Unknown 1:02:24
logo now, what do we think is this guy's deal? And how can we sell him pictures? So you know, the classic example that I love to say is like when we when we got our house, I did my washing machine and I must have been googling like, what's the best washing machine to buy? And then we bought one and for like three months afterwards every day I would see ads for washing machines and so somehow a bit got flipped and they were like all the ad companies like this guy loves washing machines were at our shows and hands for washing machines.

Unknown 1:02:48
So mentally Matt Matt how he bought a lamp like a light for his porch like the kind of like you know like an outside light you turn on at night? You know, he bought a light for his porch and then after that he four months he kept seeing ads on the web for porch lights Now a lot of you out there gonna say well of course

Unknown 1:03:08
maybe they maybe they thought he was a moth

Unknown 1:03:13
he's like so self harming month Yeah.

Unknown 1:03:16
No but like this like on the one hand you go cuz cuz you you smart guy goes well of course he's gonna he's gonna see ads for that because he's been identified it as a porch owner who likes light

Unknown 1:03:26
Yeah, but he just bought that how many how many porch lights will he needs the least likely person to well the other thing is he statistically just about unless something horrible happens in this itself Columbus, he's not gonna mean that the porch light for a while one

Unknown 1:03:42
of the websites that I'm at magic stuff from is a they have like a retargeting email where it's like, Hey, you left some shit in your car. Do you want this? Yeah, and they do it every fucking time I buy something. So I put stuff in my cart. I check out I purchase it the next day and email going you left some shit in your cart. And it's the shift that I just ordered. And every time I'm like, wait a minute, did I fuck this up? Did I not order it? And then I have to go in and look at the order. I'm like, No, I ordered it. It drives me insane. Why would you do this? I just bought it don't punish me.

Unknown 1:04:10
Follow up. It's brownie Tara square.

Unknown 1:04:14
Do you know about the Viva paper towels? I don't know

Unknown 1:04:16
why I'm a big you know, I used to get the visa cuz they're very very heavy. It's almost like cloth.

Unknown 1:04:20
Yeah, but you just need a tiny tiny little slice. Yeah. Yeah,

Unknown 1:04:28
yeah, you get your whole you can get your whole mud pie with one slice of of Eva.

Unknown 1:04:31
No mud pie.

Unknown 1:04:34
And so yeah, I'm very interested in this too. I unfortunately, you know, I I think I'm fully deactivated on Facebook. I think I'm fully deleted on Instagram. I did have a couple things I was able to get with Twitter but I had to go back because I turned I had all the bits on personalized everything. For you.

Unknown 1:04:55
I run I run some extent. So we maybe we should spend a little bit of time on this. I know you had prepared some resources

Unknown 1:05:01
the practical the practical compound

Unknown 1:05:03
Yeah, just like how to how to not have this happen. But

Unknown 1:05:07
so the thing for me that me got me thinking about this was I saw an article and I saw like Instagram saves your your ad profile, what they think you want to be advertised about, you know, because you know, the argument for all these personalized ads is like oh, well it's actually good for consumers because will connect them with information that they want to know about. So I always think it's funny what they think that information is but I let me

Unknown 1:05:27
just first doesn't can only be improved by Mark Zuckerberg making his own currency. It's like Jesus fucking Christ like, this is the old are you just you've given up? Yes, hands where the bodies like you're going to Facebook is going to make a cryptocurrency and get it out all over the world. You saw that?

Unknown 1:05:42
Yeah, yeah. But my friend, my friend disease says Bitcoin is united miles. But if there was no united and spend them on Facebook coin exact well, right. It's like, well, Can I interest you in some miles for anyone that doesn't exist? You know, thanks. Yeah, I'm good. But, but Facebook dollars is is like united miles if united does exist. So it's a maybe a better business opportunity. Like I think they're looking at like cross border sort of transactions and things like that. But like, I don't know, it's pretty like, I feel like everyone has

Unknown 1:06:13
an obvious question. This is such an obvious question. But I think it's worth re asking, sometimes. Sort of like what you just said, what I've said a lot what a lot of people say a lot of the time, why do they do this? Why do the companies do this? And what is the answer we always guess or provide is that they do this to get you more effective ads that they can charge more money for? I mean, I'm not this is not a trap. I mean, isn't that kind of what the conventional wisdom is? Why is the so much effort go into like trying to get up my fucking ass about what I'm doing? Why do they do that? And is the answer. The answer is the answer is this. There's this great, you know, you probably heard this, but there's this great like idiom and advertising of I don't know if it's a commercial Colin or some guy was like, if you don't know

Unknown 1:07:02
what's like, I know half of my advertising budget is wasted.

Unknown 1:07:05
Oh, yeah. That's somebody said, I'm sorry. I thought when you do if you don't know who the product is, it's you. The other one was was Yeah, it was somebody who worked at a I think, worked at a an ad agency, I want to say or in like the 70s. It was, like I said, I spend,

Unknown 1:07:17
he's like, Yeah, he's like, I know, I'm wasting half of my ad budget. But the problem is, I don't know which half I don't know which half. And so and that's true, right? Like, if you're let's say you're Coca Cola, and you want to sell some delicious beverages to people, what do you do you buy a billboard, and you're like, I don't know, a bunch of people are going to see this billboard. But like, do I know that they're the people who want coke. And so Facebook comes along? And they're like, actually, we can just show the ad, you'll pay how to billboards charge, they charge CPM cost per meal. So it's like how many eyeballs look at it, and then you charge a few cents per eyeballs and Facebook goes, we can do much better, because will charge you the same cost per mil will charge you the same, you know, to two cents an eyeball.

Unknown 1:07:52
What if we showed your ad only two women who are about to have a baby right? Like if that's who you're trying to target? Well, we can tell she was buying baby vitamins and like all this and stuff. And like, Oh, we can correlate that with over another place. He was looking at diapers or whatever

Unknown 1:08:06
the car Microsoft say the idea is to eliminate this dilemma on the on the on behalf of advertisers and companies where they say, Well, I know I'm wasting half my budget, but I don't know what to you. Now you know which half is wasted in the IB concept is like, oh, you'll just show the ad to people who are more likely to care about it. That's why they do it. But they also have to have some nonsense. They tell people like what because people wouldn't tolerate that. Right? Like it feels invasive and bad. And for the simple YKSZZ you're doing

Unknown 1:08:34
it for to give you a better experience.

Unknown 1:08:35
Yeah, well, why does it feel bad because it's the wrong thing to do. And it's evil. And it is invasive? I mean, pretty self explanatory. But yeah, but then they go they have to have some bullshit to tell people. So they go well, if we didn't do this, you'd be seeing a bunch of random ads that you don't care about for Coca Cola. But because we're targeting the ads, you're only going to see things that apply to you. And I have heard this party line ideology. I have heard this like what's the North Korean ideology called? insurance? Look, this up is a call. It's called like,

Unknown 1:09:02
also, do we ever get anything on gummy bear diarrhea and

Unknown 1:09:04
bear diarrhea?

Unknown 1:09:06
We're gonna follow up on that. What are they doing? Are they playing video games? Are they doing anything?

Unknown 1:09:11
How long could it take to Google gummy bear diarrhea. There's buttons being pushed. Juice. Thank you. Oh, nice. Good Paul and the diarrhea. Big old diary.

Unknown 1:09:21
Thank you, buddy. Thank you

Unknown 1:09:24
guys take the rest of the day off. Thank you.

Unknown 1:09:26
That's why they call making a brown bear.

Unknown 1:09:29
Yeah, Jewish that's the I've heard people in the advertising industry and in the startup world who like are they're like really into the

Unknown 1:09:35
high spot?

Unknown 1:09:37
interns. Nope, they left.

Unknown 1:09:41
A Jewish Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, they're real into this and they

Unknown 1:09:45
really amazing I need to get an intern

Unknown 1:09:46
they really believe in this. Well, I recommend getting an Alex who has interns?

Unknown 1:09:52
Oh, assistant to the assistant to the regional man. Yeah,

Unknown 1:09:54
you got it. It's gummy bears all the way down. Now. Yeah. They I've met people who really believe leaving this ideology when they're fully they fully are like, no, it's not great for consumers. Because you'll just see ads for the things that you care, you know, you'll just see a cat food ads or, you know, whatever she care about. Anyway, so I this all came to mind, because well, obviously, I've been thinking a lot about this cool surveillance state that we all live in. But also, I saw this article and it said how to get to this like you have to do these like arcane like menu swipes to get into the the see the info that Instagram thinks it has on you. I'll read that now. So on your Instagram profile, tap the Settings or the gear icon. So first, you go to your profile, and then there's this little settings icon. I think it might be a hamburger icon or something like that, then you click on the tab that says security on there. Once you're in security, you're going to click on View account data. Or sometimes it's called access data and it seems to change so maybe they're a B testing or something. Then you scroll down all the way down, down, down, down down on past a million things under account data to the last little hidden section, like below the fold way, way down there called ads interests, then you need to go into another mode and click on View All and then what you'll get is the screen that shows you everything that they think you're into so for me what

Unknown 1:11:14
it's really it's really just that easy.

Unknown 1:11:15
Yeah, very simple. So here's what Instagram thinks that I'm interested in. Shot shy. It's very it's long, but so they get weirder as they go. So shopping and fashion. That really an interest. I mean, I'm not interested in fashion, tattoos and avocation tattoos again, like I have a tattoo, but I wouldn't say I'm interested in tattoos. Nature. Well, that one's true sports, wrong. food. I guess I'm interested in food, I guess most people would be right.

Unknown 1:11:44
If it food food is something well, if if one is not interested in food, you know, it can be a problem.

Unknown 1:11:48
I mean, they're not going to be an Instagram user for very long. And all right, yeah. Yeah. But that's a weird one that feels like that whole argument of like, no, we're really zoning in on your interest. And I'm like, oh, he likes food. Cool.

Unknown 1:12:01
Food. Thank you. You're like, oh my god. I got food twice on Twitter. Yeah, hell yeah.

Unknown 1:12:06
My 9697 I got food and foods right above Fred van Vliet right below Fitbit.
