I didn't realize it was that bad. And I had slept badly. And I had this spiral staircase of pain that began on the back of my left thigh and went diagonally up my back and into my right temple.

Unknown 2:33
Sometimes you wake up. Like what happened this morning was I woke up at about five in the morning. I'm normally up at like 730 or eight but it was like a couple hours too early. And I kind of woke up and I was like, something's wrong. And it's like, oh, man, my back. Is that like I slept weird? like something was wrong. Like I was all contorted like maybe sometimes you didn't but sometimes just because you slept too hard. Like you slept hard in a weird position. You know? Like it's there's no winning it was we man and I woke up at five and I was like, oh no. And then what do you do I went back to sleep and you know and then I got up and dealt with it and you try and like say like try and stretch it out in the shower and stuff like that, but it's no good.

Unknown 3:31
is the only thing chiropractors are right about don't get me is the only thing that right about which is like I talked about this before that you know it sucks to get older and lose symmetry in your body you know, I won't make a ton of sense until you're older but you lose symmetry. And and when you you realize how weirdly symmetrical sounds able lyst but for me, my body has been mostly symmetrical most of my life, but when your body's not symmetrical, you notice and then you start feeling the knock on effects and you overcompensate and you do like a weird walk

Unknown 4:02
I think it's possible that

Unknown 4:05
it's going to affect my car technique. Oh no, I mean I've been practicing I've been practice I practice into my fingers are bleeding the other day really

Omarosa who I paid $30 to record a message for you on cameo. Can we turn this up in the headphones at all I can barely hear. So she introduces I can't believe I paid $30 and she doesn't even say she's Omarosa. She says the lady. Oh,

Unknown 9:32
So I give a fascist, semi reformed fascist $30 to Yeah, I wish you were covering your hand. Oh, she says nice. She did send that to me at like 9pm on a Saturday and she's like all dressed up. So I don't know if that's when she gets dressed up to do her cameos. Just good makeup sheet

Unknown 9:47
note Merlin she like you job but she looked I

Unknown 9:51
know. Well, I see I was on this. Oh, I thought you would be grateful about this instead of admonishing that maxima wanting you to be able to hear properly. That's fine. She looks amazing.

Unknown 10:01
Yeah, it was I'm like What did you just come home? Are you about to go out?

Unknown 10:06
Again? Yeah. That's a blessing.

Unknown 10:08
Alright. And the final piece of follow up is listeners is the Dubai Friday program may remember that I am in a little feud with my curly from the relay FM network and the upgrade podcast. And I asked him I said I wanted this futuristic helmet and Mike sent it to me, but it was destroyed by customs because you're not allowed to have in the US. And then Mike wouldn't wouldn't accept my dad kept trying to pay him back for it and he wouldn't accept my payments. Do you ever invoice you at all? He did invoice me and I still haven't paid him for the ads. So now I'm doubly wrong. Okay.

Unknown 10:42
No, it's a few it's a proper few.

Unknown 10:43
But then we came up with this idea of like, well, I need to give my I'm trying to get even and give Mike the money for this helmet. So we bought an ad on the upgrade program. And I had Mike read an ad. And we'll get to what we'll get to what happened with that in a moment but I'm going to hit play but I don't think Alex sent this to me with a time code. We'll see you in No, no time. Okay, what is the hold on hold on? It's a good thing we didn't test this i think i think that was probably the right call. And we'll we'll little ways to waste of time.

Unknown 11:10
I am but I'm afraid of what might come next. Okay, here we go. Here we go. How do y'all

Unknown 11:20
this episode of upgrade is sponsored by the Dubai Friday program and they've asked me my Kelly to read this important message to the upgrade listeners several months ago and our super secret channel Dubai Friday host max asked me to purchase and mail him a futuristic sci fi bicycle helmet. That as it turns out, may not be technically legal in the United States. I purchased the sci fi helmet for 299 euros and paid shipping on top of that to send it to max just because I'm nice and I'm a good friend. After I mailed the helmet to max I received a message from her majesty's royal carrier service stating that my parcel had been quote, identified as containing items suspected of being prohibited or dangerous. They examine the package and then quote disposed of accordingly. For the last several weeks Max has been attempting to reimburse me for the cost of the sci fi helmet and shipping. However, I have stubbornly refused to accept these payments instead telling max to quote buy me dinner next time I'm in Chicago even though I know full well that neither of us can eat 299 euros worth of food in one setting. So now because I have left Max is no other recourse. He has purchased this advertisement on the upgrade program for far more than the initial 299 euro financial outlay So anyway, thanks to do by Friday for supporting really FM and all the great shows. Now we're even

Unknown 12:34
I think now you probably Oh, Maxim

Unknown 12:37
that like a dinner? No, I already have a plan for this.

Unknown 12:42
My plan is to invoice max for the amount of money minus the bicycle helmet.

Unknown 12:51
So we're not even

Unknown 12:54
so I don't know what to do now. Is that where it stands right now? That's where it stands. I haven't paid Mike yet. I have to get on that.

Unknown 13:00
Alex pay Mike. I don't have the mic. Send me the invoice.

Unknown 13:06
I just forgot. I keep forgetting

Unknown 13:07
I would really I don't know. I would hate to see this end. Is there any way that we can escalate this publicly? would be good for everybody?

Unknown 13:15
Do you think Mike likes like what if we hot Where does he live? He lives in like,

Unknown 13:20
somewhere in

Unknown 13:21
like he's got a cold water flat by the lorry by the Lord. Oh, Chester

Unknown 13:25
is that a place cloud? Chester? I

Unknown 13:27
yeah, Yep. Yep.

Unknown 13:30
He's a salamander upon school, but

Unknown 13:33
do you think what do we hired? Okay, how about this? What do you know Mike if there's one thing I know about my curly is he loves like clowns. And her birthday entertain entertain your clothes.

Unknown 13:42
He likes clowns. He likes he likes the color orange. Yeah.

Unknown 13:45
What if I What if we hired like every every birthday entertain every children's birthday entertainer within like a like a? Like 100 kilometer radius of salamander upon Laurie England.

Unknown 13:59
Laurie Laurie pet Yeah.

Unknown 14:02
And so don't have Mike while he was recording a podcast

Unknown 14:05
I'm also can I suggest that you pay them you pay them you pay them and pound sterling by the hour? Oh, so they won't get the full amount if they leave. They have to imagine 16 to 45 children's clowns appearing at his Coldwater flat and please

Unknown 14:23
tell them tell them it's

Unknown 14:24
it's a project what if what if? But if he doesn't pay them What if they challenged him to a dual?

Unknown 14:32
dual? Now if they challenged him he gets to pick the weapons right? So he might they might pick balloons? And he might might pick something like, like an iPhone case?

Unknown 14:41
I was gonna say XLR cables. Oh,

Unknown 14:44
no, no, he's gonna like pop the pop sockets off on them and then throw some Nintendo Switch. The those little handles?

Unknown 14:52
Yeah, he's mad that they move the Apple logo. He moved the Apple logo. And that's where it's pop soccer goes.

Unknown 14:57
It's a tough time to be alive and have a pop socket.

Unknown 15:00
It is it is. I don't know something, something where he can't turn it down. Here's the problem.

Unknown 15:05
I've got my pop pocket in my pocket pop pockets and the wide angle shot.

Unknown 15:10
I've seen Jen been $60 twice. And she's never collected it.

Unknown 15:15
Or $69. And why are we sitting there

Unknown 15:18
and then well, the second time I went for 69 and she never collects it. And then I get an email from PayPal months later. It says JMB never collected your $60 she's always asking people to pay power. $60 and I finally did and I did it again. And she never collects it. That's so bad on me. I chose an avenue where by doing nothing. she kills my goof. So I think with Mike you're going to need to make his life very uncomfortable. You're going to have to do something that he can't look away from. Maybe maybe tell him Oh, you know what? You should get him You should hack him. There's some Bitcoin you got to pick up you gotta go

Unknown 15:52
Wait a minute. What if I go on camera? What if I buy him cameos? Are there any Do you think there's any English celebrities on cameo? Let's see what is what do we know Mike likes?

Unknown 16:01
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Pain. The knuckle rise.

Unknown 16:07
Pain gone. Doo doo doo to get them at your Tron

Unknown 16:11
do a super jumbotron and get those good good boys to do an adventure zone goof for Mike. That's very because you know those guys make a lot of dough. Let's be honest.

Unknown 16:21
I think if I here's my concern is I think if you do a jumbotron they don't get to it for like a year now. No,

Unknown 16:25
no, no, no, no, not spicy super jumbotron you're gonna have to really you're gonna have to really escalate this. And you've met these boys. You should you should tell them that. I don't know it might involve blackmailing them, and then we're getting too much bigger goof but, but I don't know what's coming. But it's gotta be something he can't refuse. You know, maybe make it look like something else that's being delivered. Oh, your new iPhone 12 Super plus, Max enterprise is available for pickup today, Governor. And then he goes and it's literally thousands of dollars. And now you're the winner.

Unknown 16:59
Well, he is dates right now he is Yeah. Well, no, no, no, we should say he's in the United States because on to wait on September 20. He and Stephen Hackett are going to do a podcast upon for St. Jude, which is a hospital sick and I'm sickened by this. Oh my god. Like he he's he's too good. I think

Unknown 17:24
well, he's avoid and he's also avoiding you. Let's be honest. Yeah. It'll be so so trivial for him to come and collect his dinner

Unknown 17:30
first. He's buying me he's like he's like giving money and then he's getting me He won't let me pay him back with this thing. And I was raising money for kids like it's it's it's disgusting.

Unknown 17:39
What if we donate it to st Jude? in a way that's very embarrassing for Oh What if we What if we take let's say let's take $1,000 of Dubai Friday money or you know, whatever you think is appropriate but we do in a way it can be very publicly embarrassing for him

Unknown 17:53
all right, I've got it I got it. I've got it. Here we go. Here's the deal. Now this is going to take some doing I don't want to hear why it's not going to work. Okay, we're alright. I already know why it's hard to tell me how to we're going to get this done. Okay, we need one of that we need a cancer kid he's got to be real sick. Okay. And he's gonna go up to Mike right maybe he's got one leg I don't know if that's an option will violence file that for you know if we

Unknown 18:15

Unknown 18:21

Unknown 18:36
I think he should be I think it I mean I'm I'm picturing he's got sit on his face.

Unknown 18:40

Unknown 19:07
I will make a wish.

Unknown 20:18
Anyway, I would. I think that that's a very good cause. It's one of the one of the

Unknown 20:24
one say, it's a very good charity. They do good work. But if we could have small Timothy Somehow, I don't know. I would love to donate to them and embarrass Mike and get him to admit that what he's done to you publicly?

Unknown 22:14
I feel like the walls are closing and I'm like I think we got them now.

Unknown 22:42
I had what else do I have? You guys have stuff I got topics. I

Unknown 22:48
was super quick. You have a super cookie from listener to the show. Benji bomb 16 shared with us where we had the mystery of we did the unconventional, fancy challenge and none of us could remember what the fuck it means. Conventional fancy, conventional fancy. I says I've been listening to the podcast from the start. I think I found the origin of unconventional fancy in the snot yoga after show at approximately 1550 you talked about reframing the shoe tree challenge as quote do something unconventional Lee fancy with your clothes.

Unknown 23:19
That's where it came from. And

Unknown 23:21
then Alex is probably all whacked out on her goofballs and she wrote down

Unknown 23:26
I know it was daddy daddy wrote it wrong. I'm pretty sure it was me but thank you to to Benjamin for for sharing that with us. I can finally sleep now.

Unknown 23:34
Someday someone's gonna finally crack the opinion of where the origins of peanut butter came from. Oh my god.

Unknown 23:39
Don't start Oh, no.

Unknown 23:42
I think we've already established john CRQ says BDS I'm safe. Oh my god.

Unknown 23:48
That's a safe word in destiny when he's wearing his sword.

Unknown 23:53
I didn't think I need my powders this morning. Man I do.

Unknown 23:57
I've leveled up my night gown. I've got all my slides full. Bloom

Unknown 24:04
new this new This is my

Unknown 24:07
water. This is God's name is new.

Unknown 24:09
This is how I start my piss water because there were we have a friend actually reached out to Mike for this. There is a product in the UK that similar to this.

Unknown 24:22
All right. This is the thing you've been looking for. Yes.

Unknown 24:24
Yes. Both Mike and rosemary orchard directed me to this very similar type pill that you put in water it dissolves and it's caffeine and like sodium and other bullshit that you should have in your body that I probably don't and you can't get it in the US. So I did spend about $50 to get it sent. And it was great but I'm like this isn't sustainable. So I found noon and UNN and it's very very similar there's like one chemical that's different I forget what it is but it's got yeah

Unknown 25:00
Yeah, yeah, but actually I think it's

Unknown 25:04
some caffeine

Unknown 25:07
Yeah, it's it's it's none because there's none of the bad chemicals just just I

Unknown 25:12
got it. I got many messages from people last week sending me studies that link the emergency and many of the vitamin C beverages and all these kind of things to kidney stones. That's apparently one of the things only medical study quality things that we know about these Remember last week I said I've been I've been taking the emergency.

Unknown 25:30
Oh yeah, yeah the year there was a year with all the ashes and you do want to get sick so you an emergency something plus plus

Unknown 25:37
Yeah. And a number of people sent me started like it's it's truly one of the only things like medically we know about all that stuff. Is that it does give you kidney stones. So So I

Unknown 25:46
did a small price to pay to not get a cold.

Unknown 25:48
I stopped doing it and I retract my endorsement. I do not want a kidney stone. Oh no. Yeah, so don't do them. If you don't want kidney stones

Unknown 25:54
do not have to hand it to him.

Unknown 25:57
You guys ever had a kidney stone?

Unknown 26:00
Women get kidney stones?

Unknown 26:01
I believe they do. Yeah.

Unknown 26:04
vagina kiss.

Unknown 26:13
Oh, yes. Women can get kidney stones. pretty painful.

Unknown 26:17
I heard the very small they're like the size of a grain of sand but has to get through urethra it's pretty bad. Yeah, I know. My English teacher have one. Yeah.

Unknown 26:25
Oh, ah, can you push it out? I feel like if you have a penis, there's like, Can you just there's things to do that sort of like dislodge it and I'm not saying it wouldn't hurt like jumping jacks but it yes, you know you're jumping jack to jump and jack.

Unknown 26:41
JACK. Jackie would help because

Unknown 26:44
I didn't I didn't say that. I didn't say that. But like it doesn't move like the blood around and stuff. I don't I don't I'm backing out back and out.

Unknown 26:52
Oh, it's it's your medieval view of how a penis works is in chances. me

Unknown 26:56
again. Not familiar.

Unknown 27:00
You know it takes it takes a sweet time. And now what is the part of them I just want to circle back for a sec. What is the thing in the emergency plus plus? What was it called? What was the word you had a noun or I think

Unknown 27:10
the one that I've been I have been that I'm not doing anymore but I was taking was

Unknown 27:14
the one the one that you've withdrawn your endorsements.

Unknown 27:16
It was called emergency immune plus, said

Unknown 27:20
what is the thing in that that causes the kidneys?

Unknown 27:23
I think it could just be the vitamin C but I think it's based I didn't see it. I was gonna

Unknown 27:27
say I'm gonna guess calcium. It could be

Unknown 27:30
whatever. I think it's like if you're taking a bunch of weird powders and vitamins is going to coagulate in your kidneys and make kidney stones.

Unknown 27:39
That's where any gorilla brain. I assume that's how it works. Gorilla brain gorilla mind. Hmm. All right. I'm also did you put the GM watch us six arm on your watch? Alex?

Unknown 27:51
I did indeed.

Unknown 27:53
are you tracking your flow?

Unknown 27:56
I see. That's the thing. I already have been with a lovely app clue. And

Unknown 28:00
now that's is that is that the one that's shares your data with Facebook

Unknown 28:03
net flow flows. The one that does that? I think so. Yeah,

Unknown 28:06
no clue who is great. So it shares it with the Health app automatically. But it also pops up quite a bit that's like, Oh, you might be ovulating and I can't figure.

Unknown 28:19
Notice, does that have an effect on how you conduct your day when you know you're about to?

Unknown 28:23
Oh, of course, of course. Um, but it just it just pops up. I've never had a health notification before.

Unknown 28:32
Right. Yeah, it doesn't just pop up on the watch. It pops up on the phone. If you know, like if my phone is open, it just goes bloop. And so that's fine, I guess. Uh, yeah, I don't know what you want me to go with this? It's just curious. It seems like you know, because I thought oh, it's GM will go ahead and put it on and get those new faces, which are extremely confusing. And yeah, no, I thought I tried and it seems like that's kind of sort of like a tentpole feature like they're really mentioning that a lot maybe because they didn't you

Unknown 29:05
know your market spirit. You weren't here my conspiracy theory. Yes.

Unknown 29:11
So I think that I did watch the I finally finished watching the What do you call it the big ad, the computer show computer show? And here's my conspiracy theory. I think that they knew I think they had a big meeting and they go Okay, we're announcing this period tracking software. And it's got to be it can't be a man on stage announcing that it's got to be a woman on stage who who talks about and demos the period tracking thing? And then they go well, wait a minute, we can only have one woman on stage who's talking about period tracking, right? Because then people will get mad at us it's got to be she's got to be interesting intersection one in in us, you know, in a series of women right, a flight flight of ladies. I think that's basically the thought process that Apple of why they have diverse presenters now, I think it would all be white dudes, but I think they started with Okay, we have to have someone to introduce our period software. And then we can't just have one so now we've got to have a bunch. Here we are.

Unknown 30:00
That's not a conspiracy theory. That's just the tech industry and many industries.

Unknown 30:06
It's called growth.

Unknown 30:08
Oh, we should have a token we should just add more in here. Right? Right.

Unknown 30:15
He's on stage. Diverse were

Unknown 30:21
more 19th century tables on stage.

Unknown 30:26
Could be could be could be that you can see you play with the faces that pretty crazy. The California face. I just don't understand why why you want those weird numbers on there.

Unknown 30:34
I haven't played with the faces because there's something up with my battery. So I've just been keeping it on the default modular one. I don't think the faces have like anything to do with it. But maybe the complications I don't know. So I've got all like series, the regular series for ones on here. Okay.

Unknown 30:53
Yeah, we'll have a look at messages. And

Unknown 30:57
you can see what I'm working with right now.

Unknown 31:00
Was this. Is this not a bug? is this? Is this a feature?

Unknown 31:04
No, no, no. That's the face that's that's it? Yeah, that's it. Oh,

Unknown 31:08
I thought that was just an amusing. No,

Unknown 31:11
I don't know. I don't know why it's an angle like that. But apparently it's I don't know. It's a nautical. I don't not sure. I don't know what I don't know. It is this is the solar something face the solar something face and it presents as a 24 hour dial.

Unknown 31:27
Yes. It's like I know, I think what information they're trying to provide my son is at

Unknown 31:34
the time around 24. And then you do have the time in normal numbers with deputy dips for each second, and I got my complications. I don't know why it's at that slightly askew angle.

Unknown 31:52
And why is it like a I'm looking more closely at it. It's like a pie graph. Like a pie chart. See how like really? Okay, okay. Right.

Unknown 32:03
It could be meaningful. Could that could that be sunrise sunset?

Unknown 32:07
That Well, I think that's what the horizon line is. Right? But oh, like Twilight? Maybe? No,

Unknown 32:13
that's why that's sunrise sunset. dark times. Yes.

Unknown 32:18
Yes. African American time. This is dots in the in the circle? I think it's I think that might be like Twilight, or do you know like

Unknown 32:28
last light and then actual darkness?

Unknown 32:30
Yeah, does it does it have anything happen if you like to do a tap tap on it? All right. Now I need to what a kid is this?

Unknown 32:37
Why would you need your watch to tell you when the sun is going to go down?

Unknown 32:41
nautical for when you can

Unknown 32:43
go home two fingers hit two fingers on the dial. It tells you what time it is check. Okay,

Unknown 32:45
this is the most actually I think this is the most masculine thing you've ever said. I need to know whether or not I am walking home or I'm taking the bus based on how dark it is outside. That's

Unknown 32:59
Yeah, yeah, there's not.

Unknown 33:01
That should be a complication. That should be

Unknown 33:03
guys other than just fucking around with it. You guys use any watch faces of the one the one where it's, I'm sorry, I don't know what it's called. It's the one where the time is just spelled out like

Unknown 33:11
modular.

Unknown 33:12
That's what the computer you looking for. And what does it cost?

Unknown 33:16
It's the one that looks shitty, but it's very useful.

Unknown 33:18
Yeah. It's the one that doesn't look like an analog watch. It's a digital watch with stuff on it. Yeah, that's what it's like the only one that's functional.

Unknown 33:26
Here's me takes

Unknown 33:28
it takes me like five minutes to understand the time on an analog watch. Technically, I can read it, but I have to squint my eyes out and I go it's what is it? It's 1135

Unknown 33:40
That's the problem. I always liked that the watch face wasn't on all the time because I could have my nerdy modular part but now if the watch face is always on people are going to see that it looks gross. Or they're going to discover that I cannot I basically can't tell time anymore because why would you need to

Unknown 33:58
I think there's some info sec concerns for always on person.

Unknown 34:02
Oh yeah, I mean people are going to see when my flow starting and when I modulating that's

Unknown 34:07
a big a go no no

Unknown 34:13
Yeah, I was streaming some c span make my family watch c span last night cuz that's the thing that I do. And I can get these pop up there instacart rate us and all that kind of stuff and like in this case here in a meeting and that screens always on

Unknown 34:24
woof

Unknown 34:26
give me a lot of egg watching Okay, so so there's this one I just sent you a solar then you see the modular one that I use the new one the counter I think a new one California and then when that just gives you a big nine I

Unknown 34:38
did the one that's the flight computer is so weird.

Unknown 34:41
I know I kind of cut into it I feel like Marco or something so

Unknown 34:44
strange. Marlon what what are Can I ask what what are your three icons on the bottom? So I recognize activity and then I think the drafts

Unknown 34:52
yeah drafts and use that

Unknown 34:54
for voice you do voice?

Unknown 34:56
Okay. Not a lot but I put it there because I wanted to use it more. And then now that I'm all know them I'll get going on beta blockers like to check my heart sometimes. So that's why I got a heart up there.

Unknown 35:06
Oh, I love that. Have you ever worked with the heart watch?

Unknown 35:10
Yeah, that's that that's Yes. Yes. A heart watch and sleep watch. Yeah, but they work nicely together.

Unknown 35:15
I have the heart I prefer the heart watch like complication. Oh, okay. I should do that because because sleep watch is one of the one of the two sleep apps that I use and they work together the the heart watch complication Apple Watch is excellent. It is much more like information on the watch app. Um, all right, I had some This

Unknown 35:35
is cut cut all that out. That was

Unknown 35:36
really boring. I have some good follow up. I have some good topics for us. You guys want some good?

Unknown 35:42
Alex's follow up hold hold up. Is it is it funny I don't know. It doesn't it doesn't matter Quinn don't cut

Unknown 35:50

Unknown 37:49

Unknown 38:02
Okay, I don't have a lunch.

Unknown 38:04
Oh, I'm chancel I'm chatting. I'm chatting with Marco Yeah.

Unknown 38:07
It's a big day for Marco and I they finally released two point O of text made guys remember text me? Oh my god. Yes. I still have white. No, I still have 1.0 Well, 1.0 text made i think is probably one of the best pieces of software. I learned how to code on it. I used it way past its prime. Oh my god, I spent so much time in those with those macros. And all of the I had I had I had so many crazy I still do I still it's still my default text editor for like, what I need to just go do something real quick. And I've got I've got so many Rube Goldberg scripts in there that are just utterly bananas.

Unknown 38:37
For me. It's I took the time to configure the winter. And once I once you do that you basically never want to I don't know how to get the winter rules out of text made into you know, will intestine clean

Unknown 38:47
up HTML.

Unknown 38:48
Yeah, it's like anything, right? You have I have the winter for PHP, HTML, CSS, Python, like all the things that I write in,

Unknown 38:55
right, but it's just so just I know you're talking about lint is a thing that will like tidy according to your rules that will clean up and structure.

Unknown 39:04
Well, let me give you an example. So like when when you write see if you install a CSS linker and you're writing a CSS style sheet, like depending on who wrote the link or even CSS, there's a lot of opinions in CSS, right? So like sometimes if you do exclamation, there's

Unknown 39:17
so many different ways you can do it.

Unknown 39:18
It's crazy. Exactly and and they all work right. And so like some people are like religious of like, if you ever put an exclamation point in your CSS to like, That's cheating. That's Yeah, yeah. They're like, they're like, you know, red card infraction. And then it'll literally flag it like you do, sir. Do he literally flag it? Like it's like in properly formatted CSS? And listen, I've made a pretty good career as a person who makes websites and I put my shit is riddled with exclamation points. And like, I use like, I use I use like, classes as IDs and it's all it's a fucking disaster. I don't do it right. So I've sort of turned that's that's

Unknown 39:55
the way that I learned do PHP and it's a little way that I eventually did CS SS they didn't every conceivable until one of them worked and then just kept them all in there.

Unknown 40:05
Well, I know I'm going to upset people but like that's how you do shit that's how the internet gets built. That's how everything gets made. And there's people I have to say like all the people who become really religious about this name really strong opinions and like don't just get some check you have to have like a system and learn it. You know what they're not making shit anymore. They're not making production stuff that people use anymore. They're they're lecturing and giving conference talks and writing medium articles you know, if you're in the shit you're gonna fucking put an exclamation point on there and move on with your life because it's got to go online

Unknown 40:33
I've fallen into a rat hole from 2009 I think this what's happening what is going on this is very upsetting or guys it doesn't matter on Sublime Text now to

Unknown 40:44
fine I just a blind texts appointment I couldn't get I couldn't get past the way the preferences work. It was too frustrating to me to do it all like a p lyst. Or something. And I keep returning to it because like text me I think it came out I think it was 1968 and it just didn't get up for a long time. Everybody thought was dead and then it got some kind of update but Sublime Text was great every time I'd open it I'd be like what if you could type in this file to like change the color of the cursor or whatever?

Unknown 41:11
Have you ever had some I'm

Unknown 41:14
good here people slide it over.

Unknown 41:18
This is the worst episode we've ever done. But have you ever had someone demo sublime to you? Like

Unknown 41:25
so like I know people who are real like fucking you know, heads they're like, really they know all syntax for shortcuts and whenever you gather there, they're the real the real fans. And and every so often someone I'll show me in the big dude, it's all about sublime. You got to get to discipline. And then they'll like start taking texts. I'm a temper temper temper and they'll look now it's all lines tipa tipa tipa. Now it's all you know, markdown format, and they're banging away their keyboard and I'm like, I'm like I don't know what the fuck you're doing. Like I can't use any of this. Like they're never teach me anything. Like, it's just it's like dazzling cavalcade of keyboard shortcuts and like, look how powerful I am man. I'm like, if you use any of that to program and like no, no, not at all.

Unknown 42:04
Think about when you watch somebody think about when you watch somebody who's extremely good. Like, like, I'll watch a video of a Ricky j and I'll it'll be like, oh, here's the magic trick and you're like, wow, how you do that? Well, I got years I worked on it for years and like that's what it is. They've worked on that for like months or years. It's like people with their Emacs, Emacs or VI stuff that they can do

Unknown 42:22
this is such a good you that's such a funny thing. So like in man there's a lot of moves and magic that people learn just to show off to other magicians how good they are at it. It's like a pretty classic example of that to me is like a second deal and a second deal is like a way of cheating at cards. And a second deal is it's not actually the method for any magic tricks like any magic trick that uses a second deal there's like a much better way to do the trick where it like it's more deceptive and it's easier to do that really the only reason to have a second deal is to jam with other magicians ago look awkward March 2 deal was and that's so much of what people do these fucking like they're they're there they set their their preferences up in there. They're console you I'm talking about like my keyboard look on my keyboard shortcuts. I'm like, dude, you only did that so you could show me Sublime Text like you don't use any of that shit when you're writing code you sit there and type it out like I do.

Unknown 43:11
Well there's a little puppet this focused up so I'm not sweating it

Unknown 43:16
you want to do some interesting stuff

Unknown 43:19
Welcome to the show I'm looking at my look at my bundle look at my bundle all my custom bundles oh god oh no. I have six different scripts called Hamburger Helper What do these do from bundle my bundles

Unknown 43:36
my natural and I've spent many hours configuring my bundles

Unknown 43:45
are wish know what script I would run ecosystem is quite

Unknown 43:53
title.

Unknown 43:53
Oh boy.

Unknown 43:57
Did you know there's a bundle for that you can

Unknown 44:03
fork my bundle

Unknown 44:20
Ah, so you hear about here hear about this

Unknown 44:26
camera and you want to go raid

Unknown 44:30
Oh across the street there's a clink raid at the this pokemon gym.

Unknown 44:33
Is it

Unknown 44:35
a German thing?

Unknown 44:39
Free convention band. Milo

Unknown 44:43
Milo hippopotamus. Yeah. Yeah, I

Unknown 44:46
don't should we shouldn't call it. But I mean, I'm glad he's suffering. But we are I mean this in all seriousness, I actually think we shouldn't talk about these people. But the whole reason it's good that they got banned is less people hear about the do like my like his whole business. And his whole thing isn't like, Oh, I want everyone to love me and agree with me. Like he's purposely saying like shitty things so that people talk about it. And here we are talking about

Unknown 45:07
I know, normally. Normally I agree with that. Like I don't think there's any use in quote tweeting people like trying to dunk on him. But the thing about Milo hippopotamus that's so great is he's failing at that he has failed to get people angry anymore. Everyone has just been like na, na na na na and even like, getting banned from every convention just delights me

Unknown 45:30
that's the best part. This funny is the like, you know, I'm not crazy about that phrase de platforming. But in his case, in the case of you know, whether it's STORM WATCH, or any of these things, like not having a place to do their thing, and provoke and be provoked, not having, you know, an eight Chan type thing, like I think he's hurting pretty bad for somebody. I mean, he's, he's basically, he's eating burgers, and nobody gives him a nickel anymore. Like he doesn't. There's no

Unknown 45:59
other place is to beat terrible and

Unknown 46:01
it's very satisfying

Unknown 46:04
to play a disabled child.

Unknown 46:20
So as you know, I've been I've been trying really, really hard to get myself out of Twitter. And I don't know, I don't know why you're making fun of me.

Unknown 46:33
I'm making fun of you. I'm being supportive. Yeah, I heard Yeah.

Unknown 46:36
Okay. I'm trying. So I really don't want to be reading to it. I'm not really want to be free of it. Yeah. And one thing that's interesting is like, when I really started looking at the those, the screen time stuff on my phone, and seeing how many hours a day I was reading, Twitter. Yeah, yeah, I was really bad. It was like, hours and hours a day. And I was like, and I don't think when I think back on my life, and my day, I don't want to go like, Oh, I spent an eighth of my day on Twitter. Like, I want to say, Oh, I read a book. And I learned a magic trick. And I had conversations with people. You know, I mean, no one's like, no one's ever on their deathbed going, Oh, man, I wish I spent more time on Twitter. This is this will be

Unknown 47:16
something where like, I've got like a day off. And I found myself laying in bed like Charlie buckets grandfather, staring at my fucking phone for eight hours. And then I go, what am I? This is the way my day went. And then I close it. And I just open it again. And it's like that this is not who I want to be

Unknown 47:30
your Will you go you go. Well, now I guess I'm gonna find out what's going on on Twitter.

Unknown 47:34
Yeah, go check and see who needs a hot tick.

Unknown 47:37
So I told you before, like my basically my big strategy is to stop posting. And when you stop posting all the the engagement dries up, it just goes away. And that makes it to me, that makes it much, much easier for me to not feel like I have to check it every five minutes. Because when I go on, I don't have a lot of notifications. So it's like, well, what am I here for, like the notebook having a lot of notifications as part of the loop that gets you back. But the first time I did it, I deleted Twitter from my phone. But then I logged in through Safari, mobile Safari. And so but the thing is, the mobile Safari interface sucks. So I was using it, but it was just slow and bad. So I was on it less because of how bad it was. Now, I am not on logged in on mobile Safari, I deleted it from all my devices. I'm not logged in anywhere. And I will maybe go on once every few days on my computer, I'll like login in the browser and read for a few minutes just to see what people are talking about. But I'm I'm doing so good. And one thing that's very interesting is my whole conception of what is news and what is not news is is totally off from everyone else around me, which is very interesting. Oh, yeah.

Unknown 48:46
Um, what do you mean by that? Just like the speed of the cycles?

Unknown 48:49
Well, just what what's what's over covered in the bubble, like, for example, my political Twitter list, which is so much better than yours, at this point, you so many people you should banned from your list? Mine is so much better. I go in there and I look at that thing. And it is I have, I have trimmed that thing down from so many of the people who are not great at Twitter to the people who are really great at twitter. But it's gotten also to where you remember how you originally wanted it as a fire hose to see what was going to be a story. Yeah, in Yeah, right. So in this case, now, I've gotten it down a lot smaller. And so if something is if you do that thing where you say, well, you don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about, you haven't been on in a while, you start swiping and you notice the same thumbnail card picture over and over and over. You go Oh, I gotta find out the big story like something washington post or New York Times, or New York magazine or whatever, just had a big thing. And like, Oh, that's that's a big story. And it's it's not it. I mean, it is it is, but it isn't. It's big amongst that necktie, Twitter, but it's not big for everybody else. And like, if you wait for fucking four to eight hours, you're gonna discover like and watch a reputable source or read a reputable source your narrative. What actually was a story. You're totally right, you're 100%, right. Like, meet me in the Lewandowski thing yesterday. I'm sitting there. I got I got the Lewandowski thing playing on my echo show yesterday, and I'm just or Yeah, no, I'm sorry, I just the c span, I was watching on c span, or the stuff with parliament. And I'm sitting there with every blow by blow that's happening. I don't think most people at the gym today are talking about the half hour grilling that Lewandowski got from another prosecutor guy yesterday. And people are talking about that. It's all I can think about because it was fucking amazing. But nobody else is talking about it. I think you're totally right. Now, where do you go when you're ready to get the news? Where do you go?

Unknown 50:39
Well, I don't have a good answer for that. I actually think that it's really fucked up trying to understand what the news is right now. But I have the Google news app. And I ignore that there's two two tabs. There's one tab which is like top stories.

Unknown 50:51
Doing it. Why can't tell if he's doing it? I don't know if it's a bit.

Unknown 50:55
Um, he is doing it.

Unknown 50:57
Oh, okay. Am I

Unknown 50:58
sorry, go ahead. So he's already on the show. Go ahead.

Unknown 51:02
No, I don't.

Unknown 51:03
There's one tab that's like 44. You

Unknown 51:09
ever noticed that sometimes an apple news, the the the trending stuff is not that useful to you?

Unknown 51:13
Well, Apple news doesn't differentiate between top stories and for you. Okay. Apple news has one page of

Unknown 51:19
google news app, we have an area called fort for you

Unknown 51:21
and one called top stories. Okay. Okay.

Unknown 51:26
Yeah. And the one that you're trying to get off Twitter. Yeah. Okay. And so the for us section in the Google

Unknown 51:37
born who doesn't see the Flintstones maybe I brought this

Unknown 51:41
Yeah, or the or the for us section.

Unknown 51:44
is interesting, though, because it's, it's, it should be all the things that you so if all my interactions with the Google News Service work as they appeared to be working, it should be about 20 times better because IV I know, I've said this before, I'll say it again, I because I use it on the web. And I very aggressively say show me fewer stories like this, or don't show me stuff from this source anymore. Like my not blacklist that's too strong a word, but you know what I mean? Or you can go in and say I don't want to see stuff from fox news or whatever. And I wish that it felt like that work better because when it tries to guess what I want in the for us section, it's sometimes a little bit weird. And I wish I could just I wish there was something a little more mushy about, like, just stop showing me this kind of tech news story. Like it takes up so much. So many square inches of my day. And I just I just don't need to know about that. You know what I mean?

Unknown 52:39
I totally

Unknown 52:40
Can you do that Max? Do you get the thing you get the thing with like the amount you get like the triple dot where you can say so in this case, I see like I'm clicking phone Jesus, The Big Bang Theory and Parks and Recreation find new streaming homes says USA Today. And if I click the triple dots, view full coverage which can be very useful. Go to USA Today hide all stories are USA Today. Thumbs up more stories like this or thumbs down fewer stories like this. And I think I my gut is that fewer stories like this is a little bit like my friends see less often on Twitter. I'm not sure it's hooked up to anything. But that should make it so useful to go like it. We're talking about this Alex, we're talking about the the weird thing where iOS will present you with a little icon with the alarm clock to say this seems like a thing that you do a lot at this time of day. This seems like a almost as much of a no brainer of like, Okay, well, boy, He sure does this a lot for things involving the Kardashians. Maybe at some point, we should do fewer of those fewer Kardashians, but I'm not sure it does.

Unknown 53:38
Yeah, I don't know. Like you said what it is hooked up to. And the problem is, I think when it you download something, it's not thinking about the content. It's thinking about what outlet it is. Because there's sometimes where I'll like completely missed something because I downloaded a variety story about I don't, I don't know, something.

Unknown 53:59
I'm telling you. We talked about this on record. is Max mad that he walked away What's happening?

Unknown 54:03
No mercy.

Unknown 54:04
Okay, good. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. If I yelled at you, um, the we talked about this on an episode of reconcilable differences about the problem. One of the problems with reviews. And that's, you know, when a review needs facets to be useful to say that anything is in toto 125 stars is real stupid. Right? So like, you could at least have the facet of how was the build quality? How was the this? How was it that in the case of Amazon, like, you know, don't yell at the Don't yell at the Beach Boys because your package was damaged? Right? You've just downloaded Pet Sounds because the scoundrels who sent that to you from marketplace, you know, screwed up your package right, or UPS screwed up your package, or you're mad that this is yet another rerelease of something you already own? You know, I'm saying there's without facets all that stuff becomes so useless. So me not liking this story. Am I so does that mean like CSC a thing about everything we know so far about iOS? 13. If I say fewer that like this, does that mean? I'm not interested in Apple stuff? Does that mean Don't ever show me iOS stuff? Or does that mean like I with all due respect to the prognosticators and the governments of the world? I'm just not interested in that racket. You know what I mean? Like it's how does does it know what facet of this makes me want to not see this? And I think it must be very difficult to know.

Unknown 55:30
And I get that this is how it's supposed to work like because we're afraid of missing something. We go back in and back in. But I don't know maybe it's because I'm gonna stall Jake for RSS and the there used to be like a lot of good newsletters. Remember? What was his name? David pal, David.

Unknown 55:50
Yeah, yeah, the internet Rockstar, but he's got the icon with the glasses. Yeah, they Pelle.

Unknown 55:56
Yeah, yeah. And it would just be hearing like the five things you need today. I think Neil did something like that too. That is just completely untenable it it nobody nobody's going to pay for it and I there are promising things like citizen which I think is still in beta. That was that it kind of a failure.

Unknown 56:18
The 9911 out

Unknown 56:19
No, no citizen with a K or not Kissin. Okay, sit this and there was a zip fuck What was it called the lady who did the seven days of boredom thing started another podcast and is trying to do this app. This is all very boring, but it like they tried to make Bitcoin but for journalism. Okay, with a KOO, I can't find it. created this in a fugue state

Unknown 56:51
where the show will never be released. So speak your truth.

Unknown 56:55
It's just the worst

Unknown 56:56
Mad Max. So Max. Max, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sound dismissive weird. So when you're ready to sit down and tuck in, and really find some substantial news? What Where are you with that process? And do you have a leading favorite right now?

Unknown 57:08
Oh, I don't have an answer. It's really hard to get the news. I've been using Google News and I collected some funny headlines. But I think we already did this bit. Let's let's do the challenge.

Unknown 57:15
No, no, no. Because I mean, like, here's the thing. Like I really like the economist, I don't necessarily love everything about there is sort of politics POV. But like, it's it's challenging. But you know, that's Have you ever done that you ever subscribe to the economist and just read that front section of all the news updates? I can't I

Unknown 57:33
I, every time I've ever gotten paid for a magazine in any form a pile I read like two issues. And then I get bored with it. And and then I stopped reading and they pile up and I get anxious. And I stopped.

Unknown 57:44
My kid reads my new yorker more than I do at this point, which is probably good. I guess

Unknown 57:48
I do. I do the New Yorker on iPad. And I read it sometimes, but I don't know. It's hard. It's very hard to get the news. It sucks. It's not good.

Unknown 57:58
Good to good to be good to good to good to good a challenge.

Unknown 58:01
That is a good segue to challenge challenge was I don't know

Unknown 58:06
if we can find out. I've gotten the thing. Alright. This challenge comes from Oh, apparently it's me.

Unknown 58:13
Oh, her right.

Unknown 58:14
Um, what led to this challenge? I don't remember the none of it was. I feel like the how we got here was interesting. But the idea is that, hey, what happens if you change your search engine? So like, I use Google for everything thrown at me. And so the challenge was this week to make Duck Duck, go your default search engine and all of your devices. use that as the way you search and then be prepared to discuss how you feel about it.

Unknown 58:41
Did we do it?

Unknown 58:43
Oh, hell yes. Did I ever?

Unknown 58:45
Yeah. I mean, I this is I did the opposite of peanut butter, which was like I did it super duper hard. And it wasn't until Saturday afternoon that I lost my fucking money. But I learned a lot. And I thought, No, no, no, no. I thought it was super interesting. And I learned a lot about myself, I learned so much about myself from this challenge.

Unknown 59:03
I found I think I'm going to leave my browser hooked up to go. I think it works really well. For me, the only thing that does not work is I use I guess, on when I was using Google, I use Google News search a lot more way more than I thought because I would see someone talking about something and I go, why are people talking about that person? And I would type like a their name into Google and then go click on news to see what the newest

Unknown 59:27
all because all that

Unknown 59:28
straight up doesn't work on? Like it's fully broke.

Unknown 59:31
Yeah, those sub areas are definitely it's on my list here. One of the places where it falls apart, whether it's news or images or video, I mean, I don't I guess I did not realize how often I search for something knowing that I'm going to want to watch a video. And knowing that it's almost definitely going to be YouTube. And one upside of go Is it the Google properties are not heavily overpromoted, if you don't want to be on those properties. It's great. But like, a lot of times, I'm just searching for a YouTube video and I know who will get me there. And instead it's like as daily motion or you know, whatever. So now now, it doesn't have the overall biggest problem. Apart from being outside the Google infrastructure is the relevancy is nowhere near what Google does. That's the downside. I think.

Unknown 1:00:15
Isn't there one of the bangs for that, or am I wrong?

Unknown 1:00:21
Do I mean that you're not? Have you done that? Did you do it a lot? Because I found myself by Friday, what was I doing? I was doing some of the required a lot of googling, and I was on my phone and having to constantly go fuck, you know, exclamation point G. Before I typed this and doing that on a phone. It's not fun every time I again, it was it was I didn't realize how much I use Google for everything. I mean, I didn't really read it. I knew like generally, but I didn't really know until I did this. And how often it was instructive to me how often I got frustrated with needing to like jump over to Google.

Unknown 1:00:53
Really? Huh. But but it's a

Unknown 1:00:56
cool service. Did you do the exclamation point G or whatever it is programmatic said it wrong last time Look, is that

Unknown 1:01:02
yes, I did that. It's just the doing that on an iPhone is frustrating, because you gotta you know, get to the exclamation point, and then type of G and it's just it's not fine. But boys, big marks for you know, easy to set up. It's got a very cool because it's doing so much to protect your privacy, but wants to be good. Did you guys mess with the bookmark lit? And the cloud and getting your settings? and all that stuff that you mess with that

Unknown 1:01:26
the white? No, not at all.

Unknown 1:01:28
So when you go to? So basically, you know, there's certain ways you'd like like the site to operate, right? That's a normal thing to what? So go to the homepage. Right? You go click the hamburger, go to other settings.

Unknown 1:01:44
There we go. So

Unknown 1:01:44
I don't know how this works. This is Disney magic. But basically you get this thing set up the way that you want, right, including stuff like

Unknown 1:01:51
Oh, look at this, here's where all the

Unknown 1:01:54
Yeah, this is where the stuff is. And you could turn off all the like, hey, do more good things can turn all that off. I've got a nice pretty he header on here. And I want that to be on all my things. Now if you click on Show, bookmark that in settings data, look at all the options you've got for having that. So you can now that's all like, whatever arguments or attributes in the URL, you just make a bookmark go to that. And you click it and then that sets the cookie, all the things that you want on that device.

Unknown 1:02:21
Oh, interesting. Yeah. And

Unknown 1:02:22
then the cloud part is crazy. You ever and look at me like a nonce password? I have no idea how this works. And then apparently it's in the cloud. I never figured out how that works.

Unknown 1:02:31
Yeah, that was the one thing that sort of set off a red flag only because I don't know how it works. And because Dr. Doug, while whatever buck bucks goes, is the big privacy boy, like what is it doing? And why? Like, what, how are these different than just my Safari settings and bookmarks being everywhere?

Unknown 1:02:53
Well, we tend to I mean, the idea is, if you want infinite scroll, for example, to be off on all of your devices, it's gonna it's adding an attribute or an argument to the URL, you make that you bookmark it. And then when you click on that, I'm missing what you're saying. You can click on the device, it remembers that I don't know what the cloud part of that is. I never understood what that part is. Yeah,

Unknown 1:03:15
that's what I mean, like, how is it different than what Google does? How

Unknown 1:03:18
is entering in that password? Get in know that? It's you? I don't Yeah, I don't, that's what I didn't understand. But anyway, that was in service of saying that was one thing I thought was real cool was that you can go and do that. I think it's cool that some but not all the Google operators, and syntax work the same, but not all. Like, I'm a huge user of capital O capital R, or on Google. And they only seem to do that with just assuming everything isn't or, and the relevance is sometimes terrible. So basically, I'll search for the thing. And so in Google, I will say, you know, you know, foo bar bass, and then I'll say, like TV, or radio. So that means that it's going to find those words that I wanted, and then TV or radio, and I don't see a way to do that easily. You could do some places do that with a pipe, like a regular expression. But um, but I thought it was I think this is I can see why people switch to this. It's, it's really good. Are you gonna keep Dr. Koh on any of your things? Alex?

Unknown 1:04:25
Yes, I'm keeping it on everything. I have found that I'm way less of a like Google. Google is in the search engines, specifically, way less of a power user than I thought I jumped in maybe once or twice. It might also be because I'm on iOS so often. So if I'm looking for a YouTube video, it's right there.

Unknown 1:04:49
I just reinstalled it yesterday. As an exercise.

Unknown 1:04:53
Oh, are you? Are you one of Do you watch too much? I'm one of the anti I'm an anti app person.

Unknown 1:04:57
Oh, okay. Okay, well, but I wanted in this case, I wanted to have I want to walk around and be saying deceased. And you can't do that in the safari version you need Why are you?

Unknown 1:05:09
Yeah, what's the logic for? I've never really thought about it. But why wouldn't you have the YouTube app?

Unknown 1:05:14
It's a pretty bad app.

Unknown 1:05:15
I mean, it is, but it isn't better than

Unknown 1:05:18
Well, it takes you from one thing it takes you out of Safari like sometimes you want to just stay in Safari. I Oh, I see what you're so I've got the super paid for version of YouTube. It lets you do all the things. And I really don't want to see the ads. So

Unknown 1:05:32
you know, I actually don't know any like literally anything about this. But I've always wondered why does some on the iPad. Why does some video app support picture and picture and other ones don't? Is it hard? Is it technically like hard to implement? No, no, it's it's totally arbitrary. Like, obviously, Hulu lets you do that. The YouTube app you pay for the premium? YouTube, you get that? I think it's totally arbitrary. No, you don't know you don't. I do. Huh? Wait, I have you to premium. And what it does is play in the background, but not picture and picture. Oh,

Unknown 1:06:02
okay. I'm sorry. Like I see. I just reinstalled it yesterday, yet. No, you're correct. That is correct. Yeah. I don't know what it is. I mean, I bet sometimes I could

Unknown 1:06:09
The only reason I'm the only reason I'm certain of it is that's a feature I really want. Like I sometimes I watch long YouTube videos, and I want them in picture and picture.

Unknown 1:06:16
I think it's a data thing.

Unknown 1:06:19
Like they want you to be in the foreground as much as possible. So they can be like collecting data on you.

Unknown 1:06:24
Yeah. And they want you to be watching the ads. And so but that's why i think i to have the premium read or whatever YouTube is calling it's paid service right now so that I don't see the transitional ads. But maybe it's because like, if you build a single app, you can't enable picture and picture just for some people. Does that make sense? You know, like, because I don't think it's in app purchase. Or rather, I do think it's an in app purchase for me. Like, it's like $15 a month? Well.

Unknown 1:07:02
I think it's just laziness.

Unknown 1:07:03
I can't imagine it but I can't imagine not doing it. What a hit. People don't do that. I'm like, Oh, my God, you just I guess you don't watch as much YouTube as I do. I would lose my goddamn mind.

Unknown 1:07:12
Oh, whenever I like go on. You know, like when you're at a party, and I'm the noxious person who's like, you guys see this part? You got it. You guys see a YouTube thing. And then the ads. And I'm not like a lot of my friends make the, you know, this. This is podcasts. We don't have ads, most podcasts have ads. But I don't know how people stand it. And then they interrupt in the middle of the video. I didn't even know that was a thing.

Unknown 1:07:36
But I am not I am fully switched back to Google. But I mean, without judgment, without prejudice, I can see how and why someone would choose Okay, here's one for me, I get a random phone call. And I just you know, I'm banning everything left and right. But sometimes I'll get something it looks like it could maybe sort of maybe be a real phone number. And I go and I google it. And in honesty, what what I'll get is a bunch of those bullshit, what's this phone number sites, but I do get that. Whereas when I do that, go search for phone number on go. And like there's so much random stuff that just includes portions of strength of that string of that number. It's not good at that it doesn't make those connections very well. Which, you know, it's frustrating. And now I'm on the phone doing, you know, exclamation point G. But we should talk about the search syntax. Did you guys get attached to any of the good syntax things? Or bangs?

Unknown 1:08:31
Uh, yeah, the Amazon search and the Wikipedia search,

Unknown 1:08:34
which benefits them? Did you notice it? Has they're tagging it?

Unknown 1:08:38
And I'm kind of okay with that. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. really transparent about that. And and also, you can report ads, if they're weird, which I thought was very interesting. I didn't do it, because it

Unknown 1:08:50
was a good company. I mean, on the face of it, they do really Sumit good company. It's a it's a pretty presentation, the search syntax, so we'll put that notes. There's so much good search syntax, but they have tons of these bags how to describe the bang?

Unknown 1:09:04
I don't know. And I would call that it. I guess it's not a search.

Unknown 1:09:08
syntax. What is it's a text. So when you say exclamation point, and then a string after that of a certain kind, it detects that you want to use something other than the vanilla Duck Duck go. So basically, it's the same kind of thing. I think Firefox is the first one to have this Chrome has this. Chrome I think they call it shortcuts. But you know, in Chrome, you go in

Unknown 1:09:29
the same thing, right? Like I do excellent exclamation point A and then I just

Unknown 1:09:33
write Amazon. So what it's doing is this I think what's happening is it's detecting that okay, you want to use something besides Duck Duck go What does he want to use? I want to use Amazon. So in the example here, if I do exclamation point a space blink 182 is going to search Amazon. No, that's that's their example. Not mine.

Unknown 1:09:49
I love that. But there

Unknown 1:09:50
are a lot of sites that built in baked in a lot of sites that do this 13,094 and I got my only note on this would be that is trivially easy on desktop. Oh, thank you on mobile, but it is cool.

Unknown 1:10:09
Oh, really? I actually was using

Unknown 1:10:13
a the Dakota Go app a lot.

Unknown 1:10:16
Their their browser isn't built they make like a what's in notes. I think Dr. Ko privacy browser? Yeah. Oh, so you're using it on your Mac?

Unknown 1:10:24
No, no, I'm on iOS. And it. It's, I realized, as soon as I opened it, I'm like, Oh, this is like the porn browser.

Unknown 1:10:32
Oh, I see. Okay, look at that. Okay.

Unknown 1:10:36
It just seems faster than the search in Safari. There are no shortcuts integrations. But

Unknown 1:10:43
are the bangs faster in this?

Unknown 1:10:45
Yes, I think so.

Unknown 1:10:46
I will get this and look at it. This is cool.

Unknown 1:10:48
I mean, I again, it's like out of it's a pain in the ass. But if someone were to one watch a lot of Steven Crowder videos and not want to fuck up their YouTube suggestions. You know, it's, it helps to have this on. Just the whole thing, too. We talked about this earlier, like all of the cool tech benefits aside, it's just kind of refreshing and soothing. like totally agree. It's totally agree it feels like it's from another time.

Unknown 1:11:22
From like a web two point O era when people were trying to design something from scratch. That that were the main thing was we just want this to be really good. And it seems it seems so naive now to say like, you now have to make not being an asshole. Part of a value in your app. Well, I'm glad some people do that. But there's a time when it felt like you didn't need to do that. We just want flicker to be good. We just went delicious to be good, right? Like whatever it is. And now today, it's like it is a value and a decision to decide not to be a dick with your service. And you find places like that. And in a second, I'm going to read up my suggestion for Guardian app, which I'm really appreciating right now. But Same here. It's like these apps where it's like the basic reason you use this is because the other apps are fucking with you. It's so strange.

Unknown 1:12:15
I just opened Google for the first time on desktop Safari in a while and there's a pop up that says complete your privacy checkup. Yeah, review your settings to make sure that they're still right for you. And you can complete that or do you know things? I have no idea what the fuck that

Unknown 1:12:31
is, you would go and you can go into like, you can go in and say stuff like, you know, stop tracking this thing. or delete your tracking of this thing. Some Some things are way harder than others.

Unknown 1:12:39
But why is it doing? Like, why is it telling you that because I haven't used it for a week. Like that's such a weird pop up to have? And it it's really anxiety inducing? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

Unknown 1:12:51
Sorry. What are you gonna say? swallow? What happened?

Unknown 1:12:53
help create healthy digital habits with family link? What the fuck is this? This is your making me happy to use duck duck? Oh, there's a Ah, oh, this is terrible. I don't like it. Max, are you using? Are you going to keep using this?

Unknown 1:13:10
Yes, I have Duck Duck, go on my Mac. And I'm I, I haven't decided the phone might go back to Google. Because you know, when you Google something on your phone, you kind of need to know it right away. Whereas on the Mac, I'm sometimes a little more tolerant of like, well, I'll try the one I like. And then if that doesn't get the result I need I'll try again. But on the phone, I really am not trying to fuck around. Like when I need to Google something I sometimes I need to know what I mean, you know, you're running late for something, you need to look up the address or whatever.

Unknown 1:13:36
Yeah, the mix is interesting. It's a good middle ground. Now.

Unknown 1:13:40
I'm more paranoid, I think about the stuff that goes on my would like

Unknown 1:13:44
to I'd like to get Google out of my life. Like I don't, I would like Google to not know anything about me and not use any Google services. But it's almost impossible to avoid, like, it's YouTube. It's Gmail, like, there's no competitors.

Unknown 1:13:58
And every time every time I'm one of us gets a person gets close to saying, so frustrating. When you get close to saying like, you know, I really would like, I don't want to be on Facebook, and I don't want Google tracking me. And like, then you get you get the you get brigade by everybody saying, Well, you know, Facebook doesn't even need you to be logged in to understand you. And it's like, it's so frustrating to me, because it's like, no, I guess they don't. But I guess it not conceivable that I can do things that help me participate in that less, it just seems very dangerous and very damaging to encourage people to think there's nothing they can do to help themselves that like they they're they're foolish to try and do anything. That ameliorates their condition or that makes it makes it less easy for people to just fucking track everything. I that point of view is really unhealthy domain,

Unknown 1:14:49
you want to do as little to contribute to the problem as you can and as much to help with to towards a solution as you can.

Unknown 1:14:56
So that's why I want to re up guardian. And again, I know, I know, I can trust. But Guardian is so fucking cool. And I feel like there are ways in which I see

Unknown 1:15:08
you know, I gotta I kind of message I got a message. Someone at guard who works at Guardian, and they got mad at me for saying that they might be a state actor. No, no, no, no said we're not a state actor.

Unknown 1:15:18
They weren't mad. I feel so bad

Unknown 1:15:20
about this. How would they? How would they know you? Did? They heard that they heard the show?

Unknown 1:15:24
Yeah. And I said, and I said, I'm very skeptical of any VPN General, because a lot of them are like weird surveillance things.

Unknown 1:15:33
And the reason the one they listen to the show to this very nice person came up to me at WWDC, and got me on the beta. And I've been apparently using Guardian since then. And just didn't realize it.

Unknown 1:15:45
I was just running.

Unknown 1:15:46
Sorry about that. It's very good. I totally forgot. Well, it's like one block RX. You don't I don't remember. I don't know.

Unknown 1:15:55
I know. It's so weird. When you then you go see what somebody else's browser you look at their browser, like, what are you doing? looking at? What? Like, what is that what your pages look like all the time? Jesus Christ. Yeah, so anyway, like, um, so I can't,

Unknown 1:16:08
I can't vote. All right, I'm going to do, I'm going to do a quarterly subscription,

Unknown 1:16:11
Oh, do a yearly subscription. I don't know if I like

Unknown 1:16:13
it, I do monthly I the so I'm not here to vouch for the VPN part, we keep, we keep returning to the VPN part, because that's the part where people are going to worry, I'm talking about the firewall part. Because you can fucking see it working. It's, it's so wild. So like, for example, and I had a really good interaction with the guy, the guy at Guardian about this, you know, I sent them up email, because like, it's suddenly turn off on all of my devices. And I think we arrived at, we do the monthly subscription, there's a chance that it's going to get confused, you know. And anyway, long story short, but I was on. I've now gotten used to being on Google. And you scroll to the bottom of the page. So if you scroll to the bottom of Google search page, right, now, you're going to see something there about your location, where it's going to say, Oh, yeah, this is your precise location, or this is what we've guests from, like the lady. And mine always says, unknown or Santa Clara now, because the the VPN that I'm using is in San Jose, Santa Clara County, so but it's just wild, because one day I was surfing around on Google, and I saw my location in the footer. And it really jumped out at me, right, because I gotten so used to seeing something different there. And then when I looked in the app, it turned off. So it's not to say and we I think I think I can say that must have to do with subscription and confusion. But like I don't you don't see that any. No longer is saying you are exactly here and we know it and here's the reminder. So I don't know maybe I'm living in a dream world but like i that dumb little thing. My friend Chris Coltrane. His dad always used to say, you know, you lock the screen door to keep the honest people honest. There's nothing to keep somebody from knocking down your screen door. But having a screen door might help a little bit because it keeps the honest people honest. And in that instance, like having things like that using stuff like go if you can, I don't know I don't want to get to a place where I'm turning into Holden Caulfield again, I just don't want to get to the place where like you start to feel one starts to feel so utterly helpless. That being cynical about other people's attempts to improve their life or something you feel the need to knock down is all going to say about that.

Unknown 1:19:12
Can you see your Lyft right

Unknown 1:19:13

Unknown 1:19:21
But I assume that a 4.7 was because a lot of times for work. I take Uber's and we bring a ton of stuff and it's a pain in the ass. But I always call in advance. I'm like, would you like me to cancel? Is your car big enough? Do you have time for this? And they say yes. So this morning, I just got up the balls because I noticed that I went from a 4.7 to a 4.69. And I had to ask I'm like can excuse me? Or their notes or something about why a person has a bad rating? And he's like, Oh yeah, yeah, do you want me to check yourself coat? And apparently I'm a door slammer. You're a door slammer had no idea. I'm a door slammer.

Unknown 1:20:05
And now you know, huh? Yeah. Don't be a door slamming. They should they should have a way to say they should be able to give you notes in a non judgmental way. Yeah, there's something you could work on. I'm just trying to be I've tried. I've tried not being gay.

Unknown 1:20:42
I've gotten a lot of non 5.0 rides.

Unknown 1:20:46
Mm hmm. Yep. Yep.

Unknown 1:20:48
Where it's like you You are a very dangerous man. With the things that you do in the car, you are so number five. I refuse to believe that that's legit. What do you think they're just fudging it? Do you think that's they just painted that on? Everybody gets 5.0

Unknown 1:21:02
I have two theories. Um, people can D activate and reactivate their account if they get too low with a

Unknown 1:21:12
What does that do that resets it? I think so. Why do that every day the wall

Unknown 1:21:17
because then you get flagged?

Unknown 1:21:18
That's like a cabaret license. That's so wild.

Unknown 1:21:21
Yeah. And or, or they're only updating it like once a month or something now maybe Does that make sense? Instead of an instant link? You get one star and it's flagged or something whereas if you let's say you give this person four stars because they're not a safe man,

Unknown 1:21:40
