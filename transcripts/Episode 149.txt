Alex 0:33
Do you always hum at the beginning of whatever podcast you're recording just to, you know, break the silence but also make sure Call Recorder’s working?

Merlin 0:34
Why do you care?

Max 0:35
*cackling laughter*

Alex 0:36
Because I'm interested in your life and I find it charming.

Merlin 0:39
Don't you have other things you need to be thinking about?

Max 0:41
These are the kind of pro podcasting life hacks that Alex wants from the full Merlin Mann experience.

Merlin 0:47
*humming* Okay. *clears throat*

Max 0:51
*singing* Merlin Mann...

Alex 0:53
I threw him off..

Merlin 0:54
I get as prepared as I can be. I'm posting through this whole thing. Okay. I'm listening to a podcast I'm listening to the latest episode of Can He Do That? I'm posting some very funny Jeremy Renner material. And I have everything as ready as it can be before we start Yes, yes, I need to pause long enough to make sure Call Recorder is fine. But here's the thing you guys often call me while I don't know what's happening. I don't I don't know what's hap... to be people that matter for guests to talk about the Bachelor. I don't know what's going to happen. Max might be in the midst of popping off on a bit this started. I don't know how many minutes ago. I don't like to be ego assertive. And so you know what I do I do this. *hums to self*

Max 1:33
You know what I've been having.

Merlin 1:34
What's up?

Max 1:35
Is Emergen-C

Merlin 1:38
Oh god, what a racket

Max 1:39
I was just looking at Alex

Merlin 1:40
What a racket!

Max 1:41
I was looking at Alex's but Alex got her big bottle of piss water here that we've previously discussed on the podcast. And I think that I think there's some

Merlin 1:48
Full of powders!

Max 1:49
Some powders and there's some sort of energy powder in there some sort of green greenish yellow smell like asparagus.

Alex 1:56
No no, It smells like

Merlin 1:59
Not yet.

Alex 2:00
Yeah. Might later today depending on how much I drink. I mean, there's a bunch of bullshit stuff but there is also caffeine, which is the main thing that excites me

Merlin 2:10
you would regard that as non bullshit stuff

Alex 2:12
non...non bullshit.

Max 2:14
Couple weeks ago when I was on my Cards retreat, you know, we all live together. We're staying in this Airbnb. When and often what happens? I mean, there's, there's seven of us, right? So often what happens is, one of the guys shows up a little sick. And inevitably, you know what, where this is going, I mean, we're all eating the same. We're all eating the same Doritos. And

Merlin 2:34
Just Joshes is all over the meats. And we're

Max 2:36
just sitting in a conference table and an on unventilated you know living room and we're all getting sick it's happening. And and like one guy showed up and he got Eli I got pretty sick on this retreat. Like he got

Alex 2:50
oh no

Max 2:50
he got like, like he had like a fever. Like he was sleeping all day. Like he was quite sick. And I'm I don't know why I'm all I'm always the first one to fall like I'm usually the first one sec I think I know who knows why. But Eli went down and then two of the other guys got sick with whatever you I had. And I was like, I'm next like I can feel it like I just know in my bones.

Merlin 3:11
You’re next waiting for your number to come up.

Max 3:13
Yeah, yeah. And yeah, it's awful, right? Because you don't want to get it's not that bad, but I'm not gonna die like damn I hate like, especially when you you need that work to be you know, contributing and be productive. It's just no good. And so I was like, there must be something I can do like I don't want to just sit here passively. And you know get get get like like sheep to the slaughter become sick and do nothing. And so I went I sort of thought through my options, and I was like, maybe I'll start taking the Emergen-C immune plus plus.

Alex 3:47
So what does that supposedly do? Who? Told you to do that?

Max 3:51
I don't know.

Merlin 3:52
Max, tell me what does that supposedly do?

Max 3:54
So we usually what we do is we order a big, big old Amazon card of just like stuff and we get you know, toothpaste and deodorant. Just shit that people need. And someone had gotten just a box of emergency immune plus plus, and I was like, You know what, I'm gonna start drinking this and maybe it'll do something for me. Guess what? I didn't get sick.

Alex 4:16
*giggling* 

Merlin 4:16
*giggling* What? Why are you looking for your wallet? Here? The light is better. Um, yeah. Okay.

Max 4:22
So now I'm drink now I'm still on and so first of all, I think it tastes pretty good. I have a tangerine orange.

Merlin 4:28
all that ascorbic acid in it. It’s for bringing up the citrus tones.

Max 4:31
It’s sweet. It's like a it's like a Tang. It's like a mild Tang. It's a little effervescent.

Merlin 4:36
Yeah, sure.

Max 4:37
So I start my day off with a big big glass of Emergen-C immune plus, plus now, you know,

Merlin 4:42
they said the old lady. How do you live to be 100 years old? And she said she said every morning you get up, you get up and you drink a glass of milk for 100 years. Um, so what I'm here to say is if that I am not, I'm not going to turns out you on this? Because I am glad to hear that it's working for you. Have you considered maybe wearing a certain kind of beads? Maybe that would work too. Oh, you get some beads? Or no, I'm just saying we should burn some sage.

Max 5:07
You're saying you've got a rock that's going to keep the bears away.

Merlin 5:10
That's right... I’d to buy your rock. Yeah, exactly.

Max 5:15
So now Okay, now you're I'm aware.

Merlin 5:18
I'm not gonna No, no, no, no, I'm not going to shame you about this

Max 5:21
Listen, I don't think it works. I don't think I actually I've heard you talk about the vitamin C stuff and I've read about it myself and I there's basically no evidence that taking a lot of vitamin C does anything to prevent illness, right?

Alex 5:32
Yeah.

Merlin 5:33
No, you piss it all the way

Alex 5:35
which broke my heart

Merlin 5:36
it goes it's like it's like as a courtroom exhibit that I used to have to do a lot and my old job was to explain dose versus exposure. And the idea that you can hold an aspirin to your head all day and the headache would never go away. Or you could hold a bottle of aspirin to your head and would not make it go away any quicker because it doesn't cross the barrier that it needs to to do something useful for you. It's all it's on your forehead and forehead is not where aspirin do. So you know, but in this case, I mean vitamin C. You know what, see now I'm doing it. I'm doing it. Look at look at poor Malcolm Gladwell is having you are you are you aware of what a terrible time Malcolm Gladwell is having right now?

Alex 6:12
No no, what’s going on.

Merlin 6:13
Well, we have a lot to talk about. We have a lot of things in the doc

Max 6:16
but can I just ask you one thing before we move off of this?

Merlin 6:18
No, listen, listen, I am here at your I'm here at your pleasure.

Max 6:22
There's all kinds of letters in there

Alex 6:24
there are

Max 6:25
it could be maybe the zinc I that'd be doing something

Merlin 6:28
Oh gosh, zinc is huge. You want to get as much as you can on your forehead get maybe get a zinc cream, you'd also repel sunburns and

Max 6:34
oh you're saying that that whatever you're drinking it's not do it's not helping you?

Merlin 6:38
I don't know. I mean, you maybe you're a targeted individual, you know, you want to take the precautions that you need if somebody is trying to burn your feet through the floor.

Alex 6:45
Yeah, what I think is happening is just the fact that you're taking Emergen-C knows that Emergen-C you are aware that your environment

Max 6:56
We need to reboot Alex

Alex 6:57
Emergen-C!

Merlin 6:59
She had a procedure, Max!

Alex 7:00
Emergen-C

Merlin 7:01
Bopoid...

Alex 7:03
but you're aware that you could get sick so you're doing this but you're also probably subconsciously doing extra things

Merlin 7:10
God, that's that's actually such a good point. That's you know what so I would be the guy who says any diet will work as long as you're thinking about your food right?

Alex 7:21
Yeah

Merlin 7:22
and so maybe that works for health to in general maybe you're you're aware now and you will you will be able to repel the germs you get from the Joshs just touching your hand meats

Max 7:29
like I'm washing my hands and things like what yes precisely

Merlin 7:33
now all I know. I don't know this is what I don't even know who to trust anymore. I gotta be honest with you I don't know how to trust but but but they say they say that vitamins if you want to get vitamins your best source of vitamins is from a balanced diet. But then you got to eat you know stuff like greens, things like that. Which is fine everybody says the that but nobody nobody eats vegetables. What a jam up I mean, you know I'll have I'll have a roasted brussels sprouts be no but that's like a Toblerone. For me. That's not something I'm going to have every day. I'm not a monster

Max 8:05
Let me tell you what else I'm doing.

Merlin 8:07
Yeah, please I'll anything you can anything you can share with me to stay healthy, and sane. I will take at this point,

Max 8:12
I took a number of flights and let you guys know I've been This is my crazy time. But I've had I was probably on maybe 12 ish flights in the last couple months and didn't get sick, uh, once and I don't again, could just be probably just random, but I'll tell you, I've been extremely diligent about my pre flight procedure, which is I take a Clorox brand wipe out of the resealable, you know, little flat pack. I wiped down my seat, I wipe down my seat belt, I wipe down the tray table.

Merlin 8:43
You know you gotta get into that tray table!

Alex 8:46
Uh huh

Max 8:46
I wiped out the latch of the tray table. I went down the little pocket in front of myself, I wipe down the little pot holder on the window in case I need to handle the window from in the window seat.

Alex 8:55
Oh my...

Merlin 8:57
You don't like to be handed things.

Max 8:59
basically anyway, where my hands might touch on the plane. I'm wiping it down. I'm wiping down the headrest on the back. I'm wiping it all down with my Clorox wipe. And then I have another wipe that I've started carrying, which is a Purell hand wipe. Okay, and this is

Merlin 9:14
that’s the operational towel. Okay, smart.

Max 9:17
Yeah, this is um, this is like what you get at a steak house. It's like a little moist towelette. But instead of being a moist towelette it it has, instead of you know, whatever, whatever alcohol or whatever is on the most towelette that it has Purell. And I wipe my...

Merlin 9:30
So you're saying after you clean your environment, you clean you.

Max 9:32
I clean my hands. Now I...

Merlin 9:34
Who watches the watchmen...yeah...

Max 9:35
you think that's maybe that's doing something and also I would love to know from Dr. Don This is my question Dr. Don is do those wipes do anything? Like you know what I mean? Like here's my I do not really have the option of getting up to wash my hands at this stage of the flight because you know boarding is happening and all of those

Merlin 9:51
you really want you really want to deliberately cover your hands in that water? Why don't you just drink the coffee? Ugh...

Max 9:57
Well, that's that's my feeling is I don't I I've actually thought about

Merlin 10:00
the bathroom that max you ever really think about that bathroom?

Max 10:02
Because you're also the other problem is even if the water is clean, you're also you're having a lot of contact with the doorhandles.

Merlin 10:10
That’s a big assumption...Yes, no, no, you're touching. Here's your guarantee. Here's the Delta guarantee. There's shit on everything. You go into that bathroom. Yeah, there's been splatter, it's gone everywhere. It's touching everything. It's been aerosolized and you're in a little vertical coffin full of shit pustules. And it's covering everything. Well, here's the thing. I'll say it again. You know what, America, you need to hear this. You're enjoying the movie. You got the pee time app. Great. Now it's time to go the movie theater and you're going to go you know what your guarantee is? No matter what you touch in there. It's been touched by somebody who just shat

Max 10:40
these these fucking bovine monsters on the airplane that surround you on the airplane. Yeah, we ask you this when they get up. First of all, it's unconscionable to me on a four hour flight that people take a shit I honestly boggles my mind. How have you not prepared your life so that you don't shit?

Merlin 10:55
You saying you should have like a prophylactic? You have like three or four? Imodium?

Max 10:59
Can't don't people plan their shits like What is wrong?

Merlin 11:02
That's very privileged, Max. Some of us have disorders,

Alex 11:06
Umm...

Max 11:06
Okay. All right, fine, but fine.

Merlin 11:09
The Shit Lord is not something that one can always just conjure at will sometimes the Shit Lord comes to you and says it's time.

Max 11:17
Yeah, he's the he's the one that knocks I understand that but I'm just a high years you know, 40% of that plane is going to get up and take a shit during a four hour flight. There don’t all have some sort of disorder, right? A few of them do.

Merlin 11:30
No, you know, you're right. You're right.

Max 11:31
It's poor planning.

Merlin 11:32
Think about those cushions they're sitting on Think about how many farts have been in that cushion. just collecting it's eating you think they clean the farts out of every flight

Alex 11:40
Fart vacuum

Max 11:41
People are animals. you're on, if you're on a flight, you're on. You're on less than a cross country flight. You're getting up and you're taking a shit. I can't believe it.

Merlin 11:47
I know. what run your finger along any edge and it's just chock a block with boogers. So many boogers all those people.

Max 11:52
Okay, let me ask you this. All these people. They're all getting up and they're taking a mid flight shit right?

Alex 11:56
Mmhmm.

Merlin 11:56
Yes, yes.

Max 11:57
Now do you think that they're having a nice normal hard shit?

Alex 12:00
No way. Well...

Merlin 12:02
it's because they're traveling is traveling. Yeah, no, it's a really good point. Is that a normal hard shit

Max 12:07
You're eating a McGriddles you're eating A McGriddles at the airport. You've been traveling, you're

Merlin 12:12
You’re touching things.

Max 12:13
You're touching things. Yeah, everyone, every single person on that plane is having a crazy clown shit

Merlin 12:18
and you say it's a loose? loose tan stain.

Max 12:21
Yes. It's like a broken lawn sprinkler. It's just it's just wet. It's just, it's just an awful.

Alex 12:27
Oh no...

Merlin 12:28
Sometimes you'll see it. Even if the toilets made that big noise, you'll still see a little bit of the loose tan stain hanging to the side clinging on.

Alex 12:36
Oh! No! No! Umm!

Max 12:36
like old cigarettes. like someone's been smoking in there for 30 years.

Merlin 12:40
Oh, sure. Absolutely. Well, some people you know, you get into a pattern. You know, you'd like to have your coffee. You know, everybody on there had coffee. You know what coffee does to a person: tan stains.

Max 12:49
So here's my question. And Dr. Don, I know I and again, I know I always have to say this when you ask when we give Dr. Don on one of our little whatever, whenever these little research assignments that I love so much. But you know, Dr. Don Could you give me a straight answer for I mean, I know I don't want to hear some Oh, you haven't studied it? Yeah, there's factors and yeah, I fucking know there’s factors

Merlin 13:10
It doesn't depend! Tell me tell me how to protect myself in a world that's trying to undo me.

Max 13:16
Could you please? I mean, come on, man. This is...

Merlin 13:18
Just one fucking straight answer. Dr. Don, how hard is it?

Max 13:21
It's your whole career. Just tell me. Am I better off washing my hands in the airplane bathroom? Or wiping my hands with a Purell towel? Or is the Purell towel so useless is to do nothing. And I have to say that I would maybe I also want to get Dr. Chapman to talk about this Professor Chapman. Because you know, we all I think Dr. Don might be in the pocket of Big Purell.

Merlin 13:42
I don't think we're I don't think we could say anything, but like, I do have my concerns. I've wondered sometimes if he's getting money from big Dyson, also. Oh, no, no, no, no, I respect you. And he is from New Jersey. But he did Dither he dithers a lot about giving a straight medical answer about how to protect oneself. You know what I mean?

Max 14:02
you know, if I go to my if I go to my doctor, and I'm like, Doc, listen, just give me give me the advice here should I be eating you know, french fries every single day? Is that good for my heart? He's not going to go Oh, well. There's a lot of factors and studies and it depends he goes no fucking stop it. You're hurting yourself.

Merlin 14:21
But Doctor I am the tan stain.

Merlin 18:13
Oh, it's like those like like the people on my list who are targeted individuals who they sleep underneath a blanket that's like a Faraday cage

Max 18:20
RFID blocking

Merlin 18:21
RFID what's more than that? And there's a one lady my new favorite lady. My new favorite lady on my list. Wow. Wow. She likes to make videos of when she was asleep. She was the first lady and she does videos which talks about how they shut off our video so she can't see what's going on a refrigerator makes a noise that is a do weapon. Or just like a pin number

Max 18:41
Way of the future

Merlin 18:42

Hey, I do podcast with you. clicking and clicking. I told you to stay off till later. Okay. She The Second Lady, the new lady that I'm super into. She said sleeps under this. It's almost like, like a Harry Potter cape. But it keeps out the the weapons that target her.

Max 19:07
Is it? Is it one of those space blankets?

Merlin 19:10
Yeah, it's like a space blanket. But it keeps up the waves that are being used to torture her as a targeted individual. And then

Max 19:15
Sounds useful

Merlin 19:16
she makes a video in the morning she makes a video of how it was vandalized overnight by people

Alex 19:16
*gasp* Oh my.

Merlin 19:22
and then she takes a photo of a clock so you know what time it is. Often her feet are in the video. And then she will also she does a screen grab of her phone app that captures the radiation that's being sent her and then she scribbles on the screen in longhand and says I burnt my feet through the floor. And then she takes pictures of the clock.

Alex 19:40
I think, no, this isn’t real

Max 19:42
Merlin, you know your, you know, your 70% isopropyl alcohol that you like that you turned me on to

Merlin 19:47
70 or 90. Yeah, yeah.

Max 19:48
So I carry I have a bottle of that in my office. And I periodically use it for I'll wipe down my keep my apple keyboard.

Merlin 19:54
I literally I literally downloaded an app for cleaning my keyboard this morning and cleaned it with the Alcohol. Literally before we started recording, I'll use an app for that.

Max 20:05
I didn't even know I needed that now I get now I have to buy it

Merlin 20:08
you get an app and you open it, you get an app and you don't have to reboot, you get an app and you open the app. And there's only one thing that works in the app, which is Command-Q. So you can really get in there with your keyboard.

Max 20:20
Well, I I use the wireless Apple one and I just I just turned it off when I wanted

Merlin 20:25
to tap it to dump out all the detritus.

Max 20:27
Oh yeah, I get in there and I...pound that thing. And so much like you'll get you could build a Golem out of all the little

Merlin 20:34
Max save our village!  ARRRRrrrrrggggghhhhh

Max 20:42
Definitely if I ever needed to implicate someone in a murder, I would tap their keyboard harvest their DNA and then sprinkle just a light dusting on the corpse.

Merlin 20:51
Did you see the Nathan for you episode called the anecdote?

Alex 20:55

Merlin 21:53

Alex 21:58
Who does that like who really takes a like warm wash cloth to

Merlin 22:03

Merlin 22:52
If you break it you say so we will be mad.

Max 22:54
Alright, Listen. you're telling me I'm gonna buy one of these fancy ass phones. And I'm not gonna wipe it down with abrasive chemicals. I'm going to really get in there and see the XDR baby that's I'm paying for those pixels.

Alex 23:05
That's true.

Max 23:06
Let me see them.

Merlin 23:07
I get what do you use Alex I get that stuff I get this Whoosh is the one I use whoosh

Max 23:14
Are you from real? I shouldn't be using a Zeiss cleaning wipe on my apple screen.

Merlin 23:18
What's it what's the active ingredient?

Alex 23:20
It's because there's alcohol in it you're not supposed....

Merlin 23:23
oh shit no, no, no, no that'll take no dude that's that's like how your laptop you know how your laptop eventually gets the keyboard pattern in the screen or how it gets those smudgy areas. That's That's because that you're going to get that same thing you need to get Whoosh W H O O S H

Max 23:39
wait...

Alex 23:40
it's not going to go

Merlin 23:42
Google Whoosh

Alex 23:42
It like slowly erodes the screen. I'm probably saying this wrong and Siracusa is going to be sad and

Merlin 23:48
No I did it happen to my MacBook and happened to my my my MacBook Air back in the day

Max 23:54
whoosh award winning screen cleaners.

Merlin 23:57
 Yeah, so I had finger spooge that lead the keyboard because you put your keyboard in your backpack

Alex 24:01
The fingers splooge?

Merlin 24:02
your fingers splooge, just put that your backpack it gets compressed, it's pressing the keyboard against the screen and degrading it because your fingers spooge.

Alex 24:11
Mmm

Merlin 24:11
But also if you use a cleaner on there, you're going to get some little islands in the stream, you're going to get some real smooge Yeah. Smooge is different from spooge

Max 24:18
spray I want to whoosh

Merlin 24:20
I like this. I'm not married to this. But the other thing to know is if you get a microfiber cloth, which you should have many of I have a pile of them. Make sure to wash them periodically because they do they get become less useful if they've got spooge or smooge

Alex 24:33
Can People not wash them? What...

Merlin 24:36
See Alex you're doing the thing again? You're doing the thing where you think people understand how to make films. People don't know how to make films, and they don't know that they need to wash their microfiber cloth.

Max 24:44
Alex Do you know the black and white wipes that we have in the office called screen cleaners?

Alex 24:48
Yes.

Max 24:48
And there's a wet and dry

Alex 24:49
Yes.

Max 24:49
Is that appropriate to use on my Mac?

Alex 24:51
Yes, the or Oh sorry. Sorry. I do not know you're talking

Max 24:56
Do you know about either the larger there are a two a two wipe system. And we have them in the supply room and they say screen I'm panicking because I've wiped my screen with those many times.

Alex 25:06
I am 90% sure

Max 25:07
It says screen wipe right on it!

Alex 25:08
I know I think

Merlin 25:09
I think I'd be too late. You should get a new you should get a new computer.

Alex 25:12
That's that one's fine. The Zeiss ones aren't but they are fine for like an iPad or an iPhone

Max 25:18
what about a camera lens.

Alex 25:19
Well, yeah, it's it's made by Zeiss. That's what it’s intended for

Max 25:23
nothing is anything anymore. You're telling me Everything is a lie.

Alex 25:26
Oh my god. Okay, Zeiss.

Merlin 25:28
Oh, it's all a lie. don't worry about that

Alex 25:29
Zeiss. We made it visible lens cleaning wipe. contains 1%

Merlin 25:34
smilling Asian boy.

Alex 25:37
safely and quickly clean eyeglasses, sunglasses, but lenses on cameras, binoculars, webcams and many others and I take many others to mean the glass on my iPhone that so we'll see.

Max 25:52
That's how you bring out the XDR.

Alex 25:54
Exactly. I want to see all the the nits!

Merlin 25:57
Holy shit. Back to work Episode 85 Schrodinger's soap holder. This week, Dan and Merlin discuss how to use a public restroom. And I liked this episode because it's an old episode from 2012 where Dan and I basically played a public restroom as a d&d module.

Alex 26:15
Yeah. I did not enjoy that episode

Merlin 26:17
That's a really good one operational towel and one safety towel.

Alex 26:20
If you think you're anything like Max or myself, don't listen to that. It’s very upsetting

Merlin 26:28
We're just talking about it's really it's about it. So yes, it is about you know, a fantasy RPG but it's also about decision making. When it comes to bathrooms you are your decisions. Did you go into the bathroom? bad decision Just shit your pants? Shit your pants turns out Malcolm Gladwell says that's actually better for you if you shit your pant. Malcolm Gladwell reaches his tipping point, the Atlantic

Alex 26:47
that is an amazing title for it. I know that editors typically make the headline for stories but what a beautiful I

Merlin 26:55
know Yeah. Yeah. Boy this articles.

Max 26:58
So So let's see. So I bought the knife that Merlin got really excited about and I got an alex on your desk

Alex 27:06
You got me one too

Merlin 27:07
which one is this little cute one know you got the Star Wars knife. Do the Star Wars knife for the little guy with the little cute guy with the grip?

Max 27:14
The little cute guy with the grip

Merlin 27:15
Isn’t it adorable?

Max 27:16
yeah I feel like it's a nice it's a knife like a little girl could use to stab a robber

Merlin 27:21
you know it needs it needs auxiliary sharpening but it's it's the form factor is amazing for opening like a clamshell package. Why you make a noise Alex

Alex 27:29
a it terrifies me. It's incredibly useful. It is illegal in Chicago. And I love it.

Max 27:35
Why?

Merlin 27:36
What?

Alex 27:36
I don't know I looked. I'll put it in show notes.

Max 27:39
Why is it illegal?

Alex 27:40
to to carry one around in Chicago? You can't carry like any knife.

Merlin 27:44
It's a tiny knife. It's like a little nut.

Max 27:46
do you mean out of my house?

Alex 27:47
Chicago... No, no, no, no, no. Like, it's like an open carry.

Merlin 27:51
You can have you can have marijuana for whatever reason,

Alex 27:55
Not yet...not yet...

Merlin 27:55
but you can't have an adorable knife that you saw on lock picking lawyer. That’s just sad

Alex 27:58
I ok this knife is wonderful. I've already literally had it for two days and have used it three times. It's wonderful. I'm terrified.

Max 28:07
I'm fully switched over I have to say I'm liking it...the Kershaw. I'm always a little worried. It's so sharp. That Kershaw that I'm always worried that I'm going to somehow like cut myself as I'm opening or closing it or handling it or it's gonna like fall off the table and stick in to my foot. And this knife I feel that it's like very under control.

Alex 28:25
no for sure,

Merlin 28:26
yes. But you know, we you talked about I know you know how to sharpen and hone knives but that's why this is a challenge for future episodes. I want to learn how to do it. I've tried to watch YouTube videos. It's kind of like getting into cameras or comics. Like there's a lot of like just me about how the right way to do it. But and I know I'm doing it wrong, but I want sharper knives. I want super sharp knives. And I think I'm going to need a whetstone with two sides.

Alex 28:48
Oh,

Merlin 28:49
you get a 1000 side and 6000 side and you soak in water and you flip it over when you got to keep the angle two quarters High

Alex 28:55
real time updates. real real time follow up. Sorry, Jason. I've discovered the site a sharper future knife rights

Merlin 29:04
Ugly web page.

Alex 29:05
Oh, I mean, well they’re too focused on knives

Max 29:09
There's something about a guy who's whole thing is knowing the peculiarities of regional knife law

Merlin 29:14
it's a 501(c)3!

Max 29:16
it's a little bit like the guys...

Merlin 29:18
A 501(c)3 called Knife Rights!

Max 29:20
It's Have you ever encountered a guy on Twitter?

Merlin 29:22
Oh, yes.

Max 29:23
that type of Twitter character who knows all the

Merlin 29:25
you know too much about that thing?

Max 29:27
Who knows all the age of consent laws.

Merlin 29:30
*laughter*

Alex 29:30
*choking noises*

Merlin 29:32
Those are the product of a different time.

Max 29:37
Do you know what I’m talking about? He’s like “Well actually in Alabama” Alex just did a piss water take... 

Merlin 29:44
if you put them in a van while they're in a mall, that's the equivalent of consent, Neil?

Max 29:49
I think that it's I think it's automatically suspicious if you know almost anything about Age of Consent Laws. Similarly, If your whole thing is knowing while in this state, you can have a 3.5 inch blade protruding from your pocket... you're definitely gonna stab someone. Allegedly.

Merlin 30:17
Allegedly...

Jazz Break 30:20
*Second Jazz Break*

Merlin 30:29
All right. We got we had so much to talk about. Oh my god.

Alex 30:33
We do we do. And I know that Chapo trap house covered the Jeremy Renner incident but I just want to touch on it please please one of you explain what has happened with Mr. Renner and as well

Max 30:46
okay. I would refer people to DM who I already forgot the guy the guy it's Yeah,

Alex 30:52
it was an Atlantic.

Max 30:54
Jesse for RO know the article that the guy know

Merlin 30:57
you talk about the guy from block party.

Max 30:58
Yeah, the guy the key wrote something for

Merlin 31:00
the block party. So there's a very fun podcast with Canadians called block party where they talk about the weekend social media and they have a guest to talk about somebody a celebrity that block them, or somebody that they had to block and some of the episodes are very funny Alex Coleman episode about William Shatner is really funny. And that guy was on Chapo Grey Wolf, the Patreon feed to talk about what he was the guy who led to the runner up being pulled and he describes how how flimsy this whole thing is. It's basically a white label app that I think Max should have created and release. Express x is the name of the company I believe

Max 31:37
it's Steph so i i would in lieu of us having a whole thing about it. Because I think unfortunately just missed I feel like we kind of miss such a good

Merlin 31:45
a good episode.

Max 31:46
I love the chop episode. I laughed. I listened to it on a plan. You know, I know everyone has this story of oils, new airplane, and I laughed. Everyone looked at me but like,

Merlin 31:53
I really, I got over the flight and I wanted to jack off.

Max 32:00
Talking I fucking lost it repeatedly on an airplane. This

Merlin 32:03
is just so we know this is on the Patreon only the whole feed so you have to be a member or well worth your $5 a month and add oh one of the best $5 I spend each month.

Alex 32:13
Subscribe for one month to listen

Max 32:15
to this. But honestly, I'm okay. But honestly, I wouldn't even I would say people should just read. It's on deadspin. And there's an article by Stephen heck called and the title of it is I broke the official Jeremy Renner app by posting the word porno on it. And it's so the article is so funny.

Merlin 32:33
He's a very he's a very funny guy.

Alex 32:36
Yeah. I didn't even know who this guy was. And

Merlin 32:40
I love Should we do a little

Max 32:42
Should we do a little reading from this article just yet, please,

Merlin 32:44
a little a little taste. And we'll all credit all credit to Chapo who once again beat us to it.

Max 32:50
So this is from Stephen hacks article. And he's the guy who figured out how to troll this app, but he goes, the second thing you will find upon installing the app. And if you have not already installed the official Jeremy Renner app, please feel free to take this parenthetical as an opportunity to do so is that every push notification you receive through the app looks as though it's coming directly from Mr. Runner himself. You will also notice that you receive a push notification every time someone replies to you what this means is you've probably figured out by now is that if you post looking good Mr. Renner under a blurry photo of Jeremy driving a dump truck and someone named football jersey 97 replies with quote, there is diarrhea shooting my penis, your phone will buzz and you will receive a notification with the words Jeremy Renner colon there is diarrhea shooting out of my penis next to a little picture of Jeremy Renner space. Now, I do not develop personalized vanity apps for celebrities. However, if I did develop personalized vanity apps for celebrities, I would think that one of the things I would try to avoid just right off the bat before we got too much of the complicated stuff would be any situation where it is extremely easy to make it look like the celebrity and question was personally messaging you have a stream of diarrhea shooting out of their ears. And then he goes, I'm getting ahead of myself, here's how it all began. And then you get the whole story. But like, it's, I mean, what a good writer like what, what a funny, like, you know, trolling. It's like, I don't want to you don't want to celebrate it too much. But like, Damn, sometimes you just get a good target, you get a good target a target rich environment, and you're just like, it's just so joyful, you know?

Merlin 34:27
Oh, no, I mean, like, especially if you're good at if you're good at it and make it if you're good at make it a sport. Yeah,

Max 34:31
not harassing, like reading game development here. Right? Jeremy? It's like a celebrity's vanity app. And it's just so funny.

Merlin 34:38
Well, it's also in essence of punching up versus punching down, to be honest.

Alex 34:42
I mean, the thing that he responded to was an actual post supposedly by Jeremy Renner in the app that was said something like what are you doing this weekend says have

Merlin 34:54
a have a rockin So okay, let's just one more thing, because this is worth explaining. This is the thinnest possible concept for an app based on what this guy is describing. You're a celebrity. So I think it's good and I think it's Express x.com and you'll see celebrities you don't know. And and so but the idea is it kind of it's just basically an app that sits atop your Instagram feed, and it makes it look like you're getting posts from that celebrity then then you can go in and buy buy beans that allow you in stars that allow you to have your response to the celebrity show up higher in the comments. So you feel like you're getting like that backstage Weezer experience. So in this instance the post goes out and it says from from Jared Jeremy Renner actual have a rockin weekend everyone what's the plan?

Alex 35:44
He I mean he was shipped posting but that

Merlin 35:46
wasn't harassing. He's a Stephen Stephen said what man

Max 35:49
wearing like he looks like an ll be their photo Jeremy Renner is so fucking funny. He looks like an LL Bean catalog. And he's been like heavily like his Look at his like the lines like he's definitely like weird like Photoshop like face to injury. And then his hair is all like clipped in Photoshop. And then he's holding little binoculars like he's bird hunting bird spotting So Jeremy Renner having a rockin weekend everyone what's the plan and then a Stephen a hack posts I will be looking at porno on my computer. And then and then Jesse Farrar replies and goes at Stephen hack nasty not cool. And this is again from the deadspin article Stephen writes. I'm not gonna lie to you for about 12 seconds. I truly believe that actor Jeremy Renner thought porno was nasty. because it lets says I'm looking at a screengrab it says Jeremy Renner now and then big bowl with his photo with his photo. Yes, Jeremy Renner picture of Jeremy runners tastes like a tweet. Nasty not cool. It looks like he's saying it.

Merlin 36:51
Yeah, yeah. And you can and you can also then go in and change your username they never thought to like, make it impossible to have a name that includes Jeremy and rendering. So you could take it take the drift even further. You know, the way that like somebody like can clip and steam will change his username when he gets retweeted by somebody. You did that you're you're into that you're into you're very into that, right? The idea that when you get retweeted by some idiot necktie person, you change your username to be something that messes with them being do stuff like that.

Max 37:19
Well, it's a hard I mean, it probably has, I mean, you've probably had this happen, at least once of like, it's a horrible feeling of like, you know, you make some joke on Twitter and you're doing your thing and you're like, Oh, I'm I'm Griffin and I'm doing my thing. Sometimes you make one, it just starts to blow up, right? And you're like a like, Oh, 20 retweets, 100 retweets, and then you come back and you're like, you know, damned 2500 reaches, and it's getting bigger and bigger and bigger.

Merlin 37:39
And now you have to move. Yeah, weird. Actually,

Max 37:43
an event? I mean, it's it's not planned, right? It's like this is Oh, no,

Merlin 37:46
it's not like you have any agency over at all. It takes not one person who has a lot of Wolfie retweeted or quote tweeting, and all of a sudden your life is over.

Max 37:54
It's just random. And then, and then eventually, and you're like, and then for a minute, you're feeling pretty good about yourself. You're like, Man, I'm funny. And people like me, and I'm going to Twitter. And then all of a sudden, it's like, you know, retweeted by Ben Shapiro or I can't even get mine. And I'm like, Fuck, like, I don't want to be funny to that guy. Like, I'm not trying to make him well, you know, that's not for him. You know, either. You change your display name to Ben Shapiro drinks piss.

Merlin 38:15
Exactly, exactly. Yeah, yeah. I mean, you know, it also it also anytime that happens, and God sees this happens to women, two orders of magnitude more. I started retweeting women last, just because if it's a really, really good tweet to sound so shitty to say, but I want to amplify funny people. I want to amplify like cool people. But I also don't want to subject them to assholes. Because once because there are people out

Max 38:38
there. Wow, Merlin that that's pretty cool. I've only been retreating women for a year and I didn't even tell anyone.

Alex 38:43
I only retweet Black Star. I'm not here. That's

Merlin 38:46
why I transitioned. I transition because I'll only tweet as a woman. I'm not

Max 38:50
I'm not there. But I'm having trouble hearing where you're plotting. I couldn't hear

Merlin 38:53
Oh, I'm so Oh, God, you're so brave. No, no, no, because the problem is, and I see this with the like, there are women that I follow. It's true for men too. But it's really true for women, especially if they have like a cute photo, right? The thing is what somebody there are people who look at look at Brett Stevens, Brad Stevens found that one incredibly small, no big deal tweet about him. Or sorry, it was pointed out to him Forgive me, it was pointed out to him because he would never

Alex 39:21
it was brought to his attention.

Merlin 39:22
He sitting in TweetDeck. We're looking at even every city in TweetDeck, looking at returns live returns for his name appearing on Twitter. No, but there are people who will just be looking, just looking for some string of text that they have a hot take on. Right. I mean, that's the thing, especially especially in like, you know, mega Twitter, it's a thing where you just you just look for that. So the other day, you know, I so I'm not gonna forget about this publicly. But there's let's just put it this way. Never forget, there's a lot of bullshit out there about celebrating first responders. That was fine, except in so far as we never talked about the people who actually suffered from an event. We never we're talking about the people who actually were wiped out, wiped off the face of the earth by a fucking hurricane. Or were just there who just went to the mall that day to get a fucking Cinnabon and got shot. We don't talk about those people, because that's too weird. What we talked about is the first responders who handled it so well. And so one day I asked week, I was like, of course, you know, our wet boy was having one of his days and he talked about all the brave brave first responders that this or that terrible event, and how brave they are. He loves the first responders. He loves the troops. And all I tweeted was who this guy sure loves him some first responders. And then reply guy comes in and he's like, Oh, you shred that's the first responders. And you know, you know, you could just go through on these kind of not this guy in particular, probably you go through, it's like Yelp reviews. It's like Amazon Amazon reviews. It's like reply guys, always click on next door. Always click on the username. And fully 35% of the time, it'll be somebody that is a one issue voter who has this one hard on for some issue, and they will just go in and blast those people now. Now imagine you're like a cute girl who's like a developer. And like you had a really good funny, sick burn about something. And now everybody collapses on you. And now your life is over and your replies are gone. And you have to move. I hate it. I hate it so much. I fucking hate it so much. I should get a nap. Max get a nap. Okay. No, no, no, I'm fine. I'm very grateful. So that's the what's happening with Jeremy Renner. Did you have any more Jeremy Renner content? Alex, are you aware of his Amazon store?

Alex 41:34
I am now aware of his Amazon store. I thought that would also disappear. But Nope, still up there.

Merlin 41:40
You can find out what the bow and arrow guy that I can suggest archery equipment.

Max 41:44
The thing that was so so so basically, I don't I didn't even know this was a program Amazon had but I guess that Amazon has certain celebrities or whatever. And cancers have like a like a shop on Amazon. And what it is, is a page of products that they like endorse or recommend. And it has a special layout Amazon, which is actually a pretty like special and resource intensive thing that you get on Amazon.

Merlin 42:04
They basically it's it's what we used to call a thin affiliate affiliate store, like you basically skin. You know, you get like, you know, an ID tag but like, yeah, so like, you'll see I just saw an ad for today, click here for this, like, whatever it's called the Jeremy Renner collection or whatever. But yeah, and it's just weird. Do you think there are people at Amazon who reach out to celebrities to do that?

Max 42:24
I think for sure, I think yeah, I mean, I think clearly Jeremy renderers got some sort of publicist team that's like you know, hey, like get get me out there and and this publicist is in knows all these tech people, right. And he's taken meetings and doing sales with this app company and Amazon

Merlin 42:38
is probably somebody my age it's somebody right on the cusp of being a boomer

Max 42:42
Jeremy Renner probably doesn't barely even knows that this all this shit is happening. Right? He just goes on a photoshoot once a year, and then they use the photos but it's just what's so funny about the Amazon thing because he's he's endorsing and selling all this outdoor gear, you know, you know, boots and face paint and compound bows and it's knives and shit. And you know, like industrial like bear repellent and, and it's like, It's so fucking funny. Do people think? Or their Amazon shoppers who go and they're like, oh, Jeremy Renner like I remember him. He's Yeah, he has like super powers of the bow and arrow I should get on airplane gear he uses, like, two people know that. That's a comic book. That's not real, right? They didn't. It's not like Jeremy Renner is really good at bow and arrow. And so they hired him to play Hawkeye, because he was good at bow and arrow. You don't think that was the case? Huh? No, no, I don't think he really has those powers was like

Merlin 43:34
back in the day on blogs used to be a thing that us blogging types would notice, which was sometimes a celebrity would just be mentioned in and I made I had fun with this in a audio piece I did once but you would you would find these odd comments from people who like there would be an article that mentioned Oprah. And suddenly there's somebody in the comments speaking as not only as though open was the person who wrote the article, but basically as though Oprah was there and would see the remarks. And this could be this is also the kind of thing where people are saying, oh, Max, what's the thing with the Iraqi dinar, where people bought all the Iraqi dinars. And what's the phrase in the community for that?

Max 44:16
I think Trump's going to revalue that revalue

Merlin 44:18
that Yeah, exactly. And so they're constantly talking to Donald Trump and begging him to please do that revaluation so they can become millionaires and this but so the people who like we're just talking to strangers, it's so strange. And so I guess you kind of the idea is you come across this Jeremy Renner presents colon, the fall outdoor event, check out his curated storefront deep discounts and tons more. Literally tons more. This is a boomer a boomer wrote this. No way is this person under 55. Whoever put this together,

Alex 44:44
are there other Renner type stores? I can't find

Merlin 44:50
another record heaven ain't got a name. He's got his new record. Wait, that's it? Right.

Alex 44:58
What's happening is this you

Merlin 45:00
know? Oh, no, no, this is the thing. Alice in the chocolate. It's all in the shop office. Alex. So glad you're bringing this to us. Jeremy Renner or his people are having a big moment right now. There's some kind of weird ass be lyst this whole full frontal attack that the runner team runner is doing. And I'm not sure where they're going with that. So we get stuff like the Amazon store. We get his album. We get his app. I don't even know what else is out there. We should explore the universe and find out what is there other stuff we don't know about him. Can you get a cameo? Can you get a cameo? Do by Friday into the renderer. Okay, let's do this one more time. First. I'm the one. No, I'm the bow and arrow man.

Max 45:58
I saw funny I saw the tweet I want to tell you guys about I'm curious what you guys think about this club. This was a tweet from a Denver Post reporter. Meg Wingard her and she says, from my inbox, a proposal to protect schools from shooters by installing a sprinkler system that sprays olive oil. So an attacker would fall and not be able to get to the classrooms. Up Can

Merlin 46:20
I read that again? Is it. Is it audio? Is it actually extra correction?

Max 46:24
Oh, I think you getting cold press first press or why bother? Yeah, I think so. Here's the tweet. Again, she goes, this is a journal writing the Denver Post, she goes from my inbox, a proposal to protect schools from shooters by installing a sprinkler system that sprays all of oil. So an attacker would fall and not be able to get to the classrooms.

Merlin 46:43
And it would be easier to just the attacker, there would be some kind of an accident net so that the olive oil only affected the attacker. Do they get slip resistant? Maybe they get some face off boots, right. So they nobody else falls down except for the attacker.

Max 46:57
So you're saying it's a it's going to create create a it's sort of the Titanic model of crisis management, where you're where you're gonna be. Now here's the thing is, you're going to slip up those hallways real good with the olive oil. Yes. Right. And so the shooter is contained in an area right now. Here's the problem. All the other people are in there too. And they can't run away because the floors right?

Merlin 47:20
How would how would the children get out? And how would the first responders get in? And the thinking of the first responders?

Max 47:26
I mean, I think this could be a big business. I mean, let me put it this way. I think America what is America looking for solutions to school shootings, and we're not going to do any of the obvious stuff that works. We're looking for what I would describe as like Acme Corporation style shenanigans

Merlin 47:42
of all the Peter Gordon anvil.

Alex 47:44
Yeah, okay. The only thing that stops a bad guy,

Merlin 47:48
okay, is a good guy with some olive oil. But we also want clean energy. So what you do is we're eating better, we want clean energy. So we're going to take the french fry oil to run the first responders vehicles. Also that same oil, it doesn't need to be first press necessarily unless it is a private school. If it's a public school, you can get that that shake, match the shake, we'd have oil, any kind of oil will do. And you just spray that egregious and maybe set it on fire.

Max 48:10
Okay, so let me let me throw out an idea here. And you know, I know there's no wrong answers in brainstorming. Right? Let's, let's try to you know, we'll try to Yes, and here.

Alex 48:17
Okay, so stupid questions. just stupid people.

Max 48:21
Yeah, and, but here's what I'm thinking is like, what if you had some sort of system where when the shooter shows up? You've got like a juicy piece of cherry pie. And he gets distracted from the shooting? window. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's aromatic. And maybe he smells the smell waves and he begins to float. But then when he gets near the pie, like a baby grand piano falls on him.

Merlin 48:47
music schools, what do you think about that? I think that's such a good idea. That's such so the key is to figure out what kind of pie is going to be enticing to a potential angry killer. So the thing is, we can't stop the guns. God knows we can't stop the ammunition. But we can certainly introduce the pies.

Max 49:07
Okay, what if every school is okay, how about how about this? Okay, what if you do a painting of a tunnel

Merlin 49:14
that I see this is exactly my thinking. My thinking is my thinking. Is that you? Do you have a Trump loyal tunnel that says shooters exit here? And there's a there's a painting of a pie.

Max 49:25
Oh, okay. Where it's like okay, wait a minute. No, no, no, that's you know what? No, they're gonna see straight through that but you know, what you need to say is like, it would be like bullies and cheerleaders this way. Oh, that's even better. That's what you're going for.

Merlin 49:39
Oh, my way Okay, so so Okay, so what you're saying is maybe it's not a tunnel maybe it's an extremely like maybe you get like Chuck Close to come in and do an extremely realistic door. This is stuck up pitches in here. Yes. Joe when and then right next to it. So it's got stuck up bitches and chats and then huge

Max 49:56
Yes. Yes. Okay, so you're gonna have some sort of, you're gonna some sort of thing where it's like big poster and it's like meet Chad meeting meeting of the chats happening this way. That meeting

Merlin 50:06
of the chats No, no never alone allowed for everyone's where they call it where they call him on 4chan the guys who says no, Intel's allowed.

Max 50:16
No. Intel's. Yeah. And then you've got and then you've got some sort of Tiger pit in front of it with spikes.

Merlin 50:21
Okay. But that's good. That's also it's easy to clear it up boil at a school. Oh, the jammers are already very busy.

Alex 50:31
bloods, you can absorb that pretty well. It's a sponge. Yeah. From what I'm told.

Max 50:36
What other what other systems do you think we could have to foil potential school shooting?

Merlin 50:42
What's a complicated problem?

Alex 50:43
What if the school just has an escort at every entrance? You know, there's there's like the hooker

Merlin 50:49
sorry, a sex worker?

Alex 50:51
A any sort?

Merlin 50:52
Yes. Okay. So you can you bring in an escort? Okay. Uh,

Alex 50:55
yeah. And they just instead of having a metal detector, you just have this have that that person at every door, and she distracts him

Merlin 51:05
with her feminine wiles? Yeah, so you get a sex worker you hire a sex worker you get him like a yellow vest, but a very revealing maybe with like a push up vest. And then that there's like a waistcoat and then there by every door saying hello, handsome.

Alex 51:19
Exactly. Right. Exactly. Would they have some sort of and they're like, Oh, your jaw line is fantastic. Like there's a little script for

Max 51:28
Alex What? I feel like there's gotta be some tech angle here. You know? So we can wet our beaks? Are they going to have some sort of rocket shoes? Or look out like a big spring loaded sledgehammer?

Alex 51:41
Oh, I see. So that if it like prevention, in case it doesn't, it doesn't work. But

Merlin 51:46
also I think I think if I understand Max, what he's saying is it's all well and good to protect the children and the escorts and the first responders, but like, how do we wet our big in the sense of we would like to see a recurring subscription fee for some kind of a spring loaded gun that we install score, or we you know what anvils as a service, it could be something where you keep this there,

Max 52:04
you know, when when I was in when I was in high school, my town that I grew up in, they bought into some sort of program. Fuck, I wish I remember what it is. It was an acronym. It was like, safe for respect. And it was like, you know, it was something like that. It was like, every symbol every letter, like it was like one of those like, bad wedding speeches.

Merlin 52:24
Like they're like, like, like there. Yeah.

Max 52:26
Yeah. But it was like, it stands for like, you know, like, like, bravery like, like, honesty or whatever. And it was like, it was like a package. It was like some sort of like, fucking Music Man came to our town and sold this to the city. And they put it on the back of all the stop signs. Yeah, they put it on the back of all the stop signs in town. And then they and then they like had a big rollout in the school. And it was like they all they were doing was yelling a bunch of, you know, adjectives at us, right? They were like

Merlin 52:54
a telephone book and half throw frisbee through the they were like, yeah, these are eight things. And it's like, you know, courage, honesty, truth. And I was like, What the fuck, like, who bought that like, but there are curricula there are max. There's so much curriculum like that, where it's just plug and play. It's got a clever name, like you say, but there is there's a curriculum that gets introduced to something you say like okay, we suddenly had this budget open up for morality and ethics or whatever. And then there's companies there you can have a Pearson somebody who's ready to come in with a product, ised aggrandised idea that you can plug and play that kind of thing. Right. And all the letters are meaningful. Yeah, I think we could do that. Now. What would ours be? Oh, it would be Acme it would be an AC AC. ac me. Academic care means everything. Oh, right. But you got to ask me Should I let's just let's take apart you get you get in a box of I don't know Acme mouse traps. For for academic independence. You those get dropped out of like it's like a big door or a big sack? No, you get an Acme sack you get a sack of mousetraps that are loaded. Those fall down. The Intel steps onto those and now you're going to reap that you're going to reap that subscription. Like no no no problem. You're going to you might even get the thing from Apple it says your subscriptions about I need the acne mousetraps. It could be a whole line.

Alex 54:24
I'm going with the the the like the reverse condoms with the teeth. I'm

Merlin 54:30
partners condoms with teeth. Okay. Yes, sir.

Alex 54:34
I'm not getting me for this one.

Merlin 54:36
Oh, this? No, Alex.

Alex 54:41
Oh, no. Wait, what? Oh, no. Oh, what is

Merlin 54:45
this? Oh, yes, it is. It is it doesn't hurt the chat with the lady.

Alex 54:52
The lady puts it up there.

Max 54:56
The intense points from the beginning. Just imagine,

Merlin 54:58
imagine someone. This is a very abrupt This is a very abrupt pivot for me.

Max 55:04
Imagine Alex imagine there's people listening to this and they're not looking at your foundation?

Merlin 55:08
They don't have this wired article from 2007 in front of them.

Alex 55:11
I was addressing Merlin's you the audience. Hello. Hello. There is a product that was developed a for actually for folks in Africa so that they won't be assaulted for

Merlin 55:25
is not good enough for us. Is that what you're saying?

Alex 55:27
Yeah, yeah, but basically but but um, it looks like a vagina den Tata, which is this folklore thing. With a vagina with teeth inside? Yeah. And it looks like a condom. But or, I don't know what would you

Merlin 55:45
it works on the same premise as a raccoon trap. Here's the problem with a raccoon raccoon is not understand he sticks his hand into this. So sad to see he sticks his hand into the box and all the little punchy stakes aren't going into his little hand. Now. He doesn't understand all he needs to do is let go of the nut, or whatever. Actually, NZ could pull it straight out. In this case, you're saying you're saying the Chad comes in. He

Alex 56:05
he literally comes in into it with 25

Merlin 56:11
razor sharp teeth which fastened to an attackers penis if he attempts penetration. Just the tip, even just the tip,

Alex 56:17
just the tip, just the tip. Right. And that is you need to sell it as a subscription service. And I don't think you'd need you would get a subscription service with the mousetraps because it seems like these are one use only.

Merlin 56:31
Yeah, but I mean, you won't pick up any bottle of water and it's got an expiration date on it. If you tell people that their their their teeth, vagina cops, or or their mouse traps or their escorts, or even potentially the Trump lawyers, the Trump blows, maybe it has a disappearing paint. Or maybe it turns into a pro violence message if you don't react with us. You know what? Maybe Maybe it turns into an ad for vape if you don't re up your Trump loyal. And we don't we mean here when you visit it's like when you paint a fake tunnel on something. Right? But maybe has an actual tunnel behind it. We just don't tell you. So someone does run into the painting. Turns out it's actually a tunnel you should have bought the upgrade where we don't actually install a tunnel so it's all there in the document. First you have to solve my riddle.

Alex 57:28
It is a morning. Wow. Or an afternoon. What time Oh, it's afternoon for us. Are you going to be okay, we started a little bit late today. Are you going to be able to have your phone at your regular time?

Merlin 57:41
Oh no, I'm great. I'm great. Oh my cool baby. Come someone or own new Oh no. We had a challenge kind of see the challenge for the after shows too depressing.

Alex 57:55
That's not what Oh, okay. That was a weird thing to say. Why is it mean I think I know why it's depressing but but protest what

Merlin 58:04
well you guys you guys you guys got got already talked about it. We got car to catch by Syracuse. Hardly. Damn it. Yeah, no.

Max 58:18
I'm going to shoot up this podcast now.

Merlin 58:20
Slender Man Slender Man beat you to it. Yeah, he's

Alex 58:22
he's stealing revenue from us Really?

Merlin 58:25
Getting all the cheerleaders. Wow. He loves the internet. I could see him going on a forum. Hi, Alex. How do you buy a gun? Oh, oh, no, no,

Alex 58:38
no. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

Merlin 59:04
Alexa, thank a first responder.

Max 59:08
Oh, Happy 911 guys. Uh, yeah, I was only waiting this long to see if you remembered but you know, I guess I'm the only one who's remembering 911. Did you Oh,

Merlin 59:16
sorry. Did you see the Giuliani video? Oh, what happened? Oh, dear. Oh, there's so many good layers to this. Should we watch this together? Yes. Let's go to the Twitter account of the mayor of the mayor of 911.

Max 59:27
So are we not? Are we not doing our challenge? We're not going to talk about Apple.

Merlin 59:30
Nobody do it. That's fine. That's fine. We could totally do it. Nevermind Nevermind. we'll forget what episode. Where can you hear us talk about Rudolph Giuliani the mayor the mayor of tragedy Where can you hear us talk about him?

Max 59:39
Oh, you can hear that and all my carefully laid out plans to take down this the crow podcast that's khaki and black build me as I turned into a as I turned into a corn corn cow at give us your fucking money calm and support the Dubai Friday Patreon. Now you're probably wondering how you know because we could be years away from actually bring any of our wonderful acne products to market to protect the children. And you're probably wondering, how can you support us until we get these things into we're up and running? Yeah, because we do project hockey stick growth. I mean, like, you know, there's equity we could literally

Merlin 1:00:17
sell them.

Max 1:00:19
It's like as Nathan's Anthony's infielder says, he goes when some guys like, I don't think this is gonna work. And he goes, No, I've run it through my head at many. I've run it through my head a lot. And it works every time. He goes every time I run it through my head, it works perfectly.

Merlin 1:00:32
Why is it when he says the phrase my beard, I laugh and laugh? I was in the sky. So I decided to wear my help us support the children and thank the first responders.

Max 1:00:45
That's right. That's right. I mean, I mean, yeah, we're developing our various

Merlin 1:00:50
you know, how many of these kids could could be future that could be future troops? Have you thought about that? Yeah, you're building a future true. keep them alive. For now. That's a we say, listen, listen,

Max 1:01:02
not a respect we could be. We could be years away from our cherry pie bear trap technology. So please support us go to give us your money.com you give us $5 a month, what do you get an exchange, you get access to the super secret private RSS feed of the Dubai Friday after show. That's where we plan out next week's challenge. Most weeks, the weeks that I'm here, we remember to do it. Of course, if I leave, everything goes shit. But that's where we plan out the next week's challenge. So you can follow so also tell them about the discourse until about the discord what's going at home? Oh, yes. And we also have Well, this is not just for our Patreon members. But in fact, for all of the wonderful listeners of the Dubai Friday, nation out there, we have a Discord server. And that's where you can gather to talk and it's actually a very wonderful and friendly little corner of the internet. That is well moderated by our outstanding moderator team. And I think the link to that will be in the show notes. I don't remember how people join that but maybe someone on the discord will buy us like a vanity you are RL or something like that. So that we can say it on the podcast. Come on, come and join us. Like people are always doing nice things for each other and they're like, I don't know they're like buying each other pizzas and and, and you know, making nice comments and talking about the news. I don't know what they do in there. They have a whole civilization they're scurrying around chattering and things it's very nice to watch your mom from above. You know,

Alex 1:02:21
I lurk often and I'm like how can strangers be this nice to each other on the

Merlin 1:02:26
internet later regime? Keep waiting for it to break.

Alex 1:02:29
That's true.

Max 1:02:31
Like honestly, anyone who's anyone who I've been power I had trained the mods early we did you know train them like a child soldiers. And I was just like, just like used to kill indiscriminately feel nothing. And so that anyone who's crossed anyone who they get a weird vibe from they just terminate them from the server.

Alex 1:02:48
Yeah, if I find you vaguely upsetting Nope, nope. No more. No more.

Merlin 1:02:53
It's not It's not my job. Here's the thing in life, it's not my job to explain why you're creepy. Yeah, you know, I'll try to give some pointers on the journey but I'm not going to cancel anything to take the time to tell you what your

Max 1:03:05
big rookie mistake sometimes people join the server and a lot of people on the server have modified their their usernames to put their pronouns in. And one of the first things people will do when they join the server occasionally is they'll make some joke they'll do funny pronouns I'll make some comment about it. Guess what you're getting fucking band right away. Only I'm allowed to do that. Yeah, lame. It's not even that it's offensive. It's just what to do you know what a bad joke that I don't want to hang out with you that's a bad joke.

Merlin 1:03:27
I didn't know bad jokes Hello

Alex 1:03:29
I did it first I did it first and then but you're different

Merlin 1:03:31
you're special you're privileged you're

Alex 1:03:35
basically a god to these people. I have is it is a moral moral there I keep thinking maybe I should i don't i don't know.

Max 1:03:46
Not everybody you're basically a deity these people Yeah, yeah, you can't stop it at this point. They're they're all there because they think you might post a picture of your feet someday

Alex 1:03:53
right? I've been thinking if if you um I think I might put a picture of my hand in the discord

Merlin 1:04:01
yeah good hand or your

Alex 1:04:05
hand yeah my Frank and hand it's it's I

Max 1:04:12
know it's a Dumbledore he is the crumble that she is a crumpled up little wizard.

Merlin 1:04:16
Oh, I thought you made talking about when Peter Parker gets the silver head and he said grateful

Max 1:04:20
No, it's our drink the poison and know what is it? No, she put the Kairos

Merlin 1:04:24
made the wrong reference. She

Max 1:04:27
She put the purse ring on and then her hand got all

Merlin 1:04:30
that Dumbledore hand then you got to put in the water fountain. Yes, yes. boiler.

Max 1:04:33
Okay, well, no. I think soon she'll be drinking the shall drink the insanity poison.

Alex 1:04:41
It's fine. Everything's

Max 1:04:42
that might be the PIs water up.

Alex 1:04:44
Oh, dear, big business boys. Do we want to talk about the thing that Kevin has? No.

Max 1:04:52
I'll say Well, here's what I'll say. Let's have we have another we have another layer of the Patreon, another layer of the Patreon and that's for our elite $10 people. These are real, real killers, who would you know, eventually they'll they'll kill for us. And if you sign up on the $10 level, we do send you little treats in the mail. And it's been a while since we sent a little treat in the mail. But we have a fucking banger come in? Probably I would say in the next I think we're probably what, three four weeks out? Maybe I

Merlin 1:05:17
write the thing. Okay.

Max 1:05:19
I really it's really it's really well,

Merlin 1:05:21
easy. Let's manage expecting less.

Alex 1:05:23
Yeah,

Max 1:05:24
let's let's not do that. I know probably by the end of the year, you'll get it sometime in 2022. You get it?

Merlin 1:05:29
You get what you get. You don't get upset.

Max 1:05:31
You'll get it during Trump's second term.

Merlin 1:05:33
Second of age.

Max 1:05:34
Oh, boy. This I didn't say last. He's

Merlin 1:05:37
threatening. He's threatening. He's threatening his administration. Yeah,

Alex 1:05:40
I will just tease this out and say that I am very excited to use this product because I haven't been able to for a while. So by the time I get it, I will be able to play with it. And I'm excited. You're

Merlin 1:05:51
making it sound a lot of good till though. The

Max 1:05:58
Alright, it's a fun. Don't get too excited. It's a it's a fun The boy is. He goes, Yeah, yes. Yeah. I mean, why are we doing it wants your money and you can go to give us your phone give us $5 or if you want a treat, if you want to be a good boy, and you want to treat you give us $10 and you'll get you'll go you know Giga will send you in the mail. Okay, our challenge this week was to watch the apple keynote, which we did

Alex 1:06:21
Yes. In in theater in our office in complete darkness.

Max 1:06:25
The Steve Jobs theater.

Alex 1:06:26
Yeah. Oh, you die. Can we call it the Temkin theater? Oh,

Max 1:06:32
if I die, I'm gonna die.

Alex 1:06:33
If you die and I'll let you die. I will circle back to I guess.

Max 1:06:44
I can you say if you die, if

Alex 1:06:47
I know Well, well,

Max 1:06:49
I'm dying. I'm dying.

Merlin 1:06:50
So the challenge was to watch the apple keynote the September event in which they announced the iPhone and other things to place at the Steve Jobs theater in spaceship and they talked about a bunch of stuff introduce some new products.

Max 1:07:04
Alex, your reactions go. You got very excited about the purple phone. That's what I remember.

Alex 1:07:08
That was all right. All right. This keynote was a roller coaster for me. Because after you know the whole Apple TV plus announcement, which is their streaming service, where they're basically giving it away for free and begging people, please, please buy this. You bought an iPhone here. Right? You get it for the whole year for free.

Merlin 1:07:28
will also throw in a YouTube album

Max 1:07:30
for 99 I or Tim Cook will show you his feed on it. Yeah, please, please, please.

Alex 1:07:41
I am genuinely genuinely excited about Apple arcade. And you can there was a slide showing off a bunch of the games that

Merlin 1:07:49
will be a price that

Alex 1:07:51
yes it's also for 99 I'll pay

Max 1:07:53
for the fuck out of that

Merlin 1:07:54
for a fit know for a family. That's a good price for that's pretty good.

Alex 1:07:58
Like Apple TV games too. And you can see in the top left corner friend of the shows at gage is making a game with Pendleton Ward. The KI know that name.

Merlin 1:08:09
What's that name from

Alex 1:08:10
Adventure Time guy? Oh pen from okay.

Merlin 1:08:13
Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah. Really? That's cool. Right, right. So the internet more I'm way behind on this.

Alex 1:08:20
I was zooming into all the things. I'm like, wait, wait, what's what's happening? What's happening? So that was Finn's original name.

Merlin 1:08:26
Oh, Pat was paying. Yeah, yeah. The pilot is pen. Yeah.

Alex 1:08:29
That that. I Ok. I will go I don't want to talk about the pilot

Merlin 1:08:35
pilots. Very good.

Alex 1:08:36
Guys. Very good. Weird. I love it. Mathematical. Oh. Okay. So then then we get to the iPhone 11. Which is gorgeous. Because finally finally finally, there's a purple iPhone. But of course, there's no telephoto lens there. There are two lenses but one is a widescreen lens, not a telephoto lens.

Merlin 1:08:58
Are you talking about the less costly one and the more costly will

Alex 1:09:02
be I found 11 which is the less costly one that is just the iPhone 11 there's no Pro Plus maximum in involved with this. Okay, it's the one that comes in the pretty colors. I got all excited. But then then the big boys came out the iPhone pros. And seriously though, that camera Wow. So much the food photography, but this the video shit you can do? Yeah, you can. Oh my god, UI. Okay. All right. All right.

Merlin 1:09:35
Tim said that we're will enjoy it. Actually demanded it.

Alex 1:09:38
I am. I'm very excited to see what I do with it.

Merlin 1:09:42
It was a very aggressive about letting us know that we will have this. But it does look cool. It looks cool. And also you can make a Hollywood movie with it. That's why it's bro.

Max 1:09:49
All right, I lost my shit. When I was I had to leave halfway through the keynote because I had actual work to do. But, uh, you know, I was hoping I was hoping that my partner would call me me and told me that they were transitioning in their gender, and then it'd be like, now

Merlin 1:10:08
the camera doesn't look very cool.

Max 1:10:09
But when they when they showed the app where you can record all the camera angles simultaneously and then like later, like edit between them. I lost my shit, especially the front and back camera together. I mean, I'm going to use that that's a really perfect documentary. That's an unbelievable, that's that's different and better than I own a lot of weird, weird cameras. I mean, I have like a one of those little 360 cameras and a little I've, you know, stabilized cameras. And you know, we have a lot of weird little camera devices. I am telling you there is nothing on the market like that. That is a unique Yes. That is years ahead of its time. That is really like a like a little it's like a little you know thing like Message in a Bottle from the future. It's very like old school Apple did you drop that all of a sudden, there's an end up like as a thing now,

Alex 1:10:55
I I like my jaw genuinely dropped and I made a weird noise that upset Kevin button. Also, Filmic Pro is an app that's been around forever, and you can get it now I highly, highly recommend it.

Merlin 1:11:09
I got that I started I started using that when we did the video blogging challenge and got the Yeah, the DJI MOBAs What

Alex 1:11:16
does it do? It just has better manual controls, and you can and it's supported by that. gimbal. So you can do stuff, whereas you can't I don't use that.

Max 1:11:27
Sorry, what gimbal the DJI?

Merlin 1:11:29
Do we get that? Yeah, they have a new one. It looks really good to

Alex 1:11:33
Joe I, I'm in denial about it because I don't I'm not gonna I'm not gonna buy it here. Alright, so, um, so can you tell me what I don't know. Okay. First, what does that have to do with the gimbal? I'm trying to get my head around it part the first there's an app called Filmic Pro that allows you to just take advantage of the iPhone camera in a more granular way, because you can set the I to pick you get to pick combinations of resolution,

Merlin 1:11:58
right, all the various is things more optional.

Alex 1:12:00
And also you can set focus and stuff that it's

Merlin 1:12:05
a wide for video.

Alex 1:12:06
Yeah, yes. Yes, I'm part the second, it integrates with DDGI, iPhone gimbal, as well as I think another or sorry, yes. So when you say it integrates, like, I'm trying to understand what does what

Merlin 1:12:20
does Max, Max, Max Max, there's a handheld gimbal that I thought we all bought that I own

Max 1:12:25
it, I own it. But I'm trying what I'm trying to understand is how does

Merlin 1:12:29
God you don't you seek first to understand it does not support many, many different kinds of apps. This one integrates with it so that you can open up the Filmic Pro mobile video app, which is a very capable video shooting app for iOS. And what you can do is you can then it will enable you to use and manipulate the asthma mobile like they work together. That's the thing,

Alex 1:12:50
right? So a little number following you.

Max 1:12:52
I'm following you that the app works with the gimbal and what I'm trying to understand is what does that mean?

Alex 1:12:57
You know, the little nubbin on the gimbal it allows you to the choice just move around a sec Yeah. Okay, so it's not called the gimbal click great. Be it it sorry, lucky me today Am I there? We're having a week okay, the reason Okay, the reason why that works better is it's you can push the buttons and it will automatically like go you can set it to different things like a follow focus or change the iris and so it's basically integrates with the hardware in a way that you can manipulate the software via the little dingus so

Max 1:13:36
the little buttons on the gimbal work even when you're in the other app

Merlin 1:13:39
the hardware understands the software and the software understands the hardware.

Max 1:13:43
No I fall I that part I get it. Exactly. I mean what you could say is they work together when I'm trying my last name is my fault any features what defeat so I'm with you. What I want to know is like what can you do with that what features they said they said it's still at the warehouse.

Alex 1:14:00
Oh and always on Apple Watch. Or

Max 1:14:04
I'm excited to see what I do with it.

Alex 1:14:05
Yeah, yeah, I'm excited will love it. You will love it.

Merlin 1:14:07
I love it. My fucking you will love it. You will love

Alex 1:14:14
it. I know.

Merlin 1:14:16
I will buy this you're a goose. I am the garage. You will buy all of these things. And you will be happy you will love them. You will be happy by them by the green phone by the green phone and you will be happy

Max 1:14:30
I did get a big laugh when they showed the always on watch because like a whole pitch for that is like Don't you fucking hate how you go to look at your watch? And it's what kind of animal lives their life where they look down in their watches off? I mean, how can we get go? How could you wake up

Merlin 1:14:48
and get just tapping with my nose and I can see what time it is what Yes.

Max 1:14:52
Yeah, how could you people yeah, filthy animals go through your miserable lives without being able to look at your watch what is wrong with you people anyway, we have a new watch was always on and everyone's Okay, no.

Merlin 1:15:07
I don't think you understand you getting it people. Are you getting this? Are you getting this? It's a watch where you can look at it. And you'll see what time it is. Are you getting this

Alex 1:15:19
hold on anytime.

Merlin 1:15:21
Anytime. There's time for time. The time to look is now because you know you don't have to use your nose. Who knows?

Max 1:15:30
Yeah, it's real time follow up. I've sent out my to my network. This program I was talking about it that they had in my hometown. What the acronyms that was on the background? Oh yes. The Music Man and I have it. It's called the six pillars of character. But the six pillars of this I'm reading from the city website.

Merlin 1:15:52
Honesty, grit, splendid Blood Sweat toil, tears regular BM.

Max 1:16:00
Looking at it, so Oh, so here they are. I'm going to read from the website but I'll just jump ahead and say the six building blocks of character, trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring and citizenship

Alex 1:16:11
shouldn't share.

Max 1:16:29
Let me read the little spiel the six pillars of character is an integral part of the Highland Park community was solely for productive citizens of the city. So better children's need to develop a set of core values so that they can build on and call on throughout their lives to guide their behavior and attitudes. They also need adults serving as role models of good character six building blocks of character trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring and citizenship. form the foundation of character education. these building blocks are inseparable parts of a complete attitude that will help children reduce my sleep of achievement not true develop personal integrity and for adults to live together in a civil manner. This is a bunch of fucking gobbledygook It doesn't mean anything.

Merlin 1:17:12
You're it's pure. It's not even it's not even Boomer. It's just It's so fucking bill bennett. Remember bill bennett and the entire fucking rolling shit show of him in the 90s and his virtue books and all that stuff. Remember how he goes on and on and on about virtue? It's that it's that saying that? Of course he was. He was a gambling problem that he had. It's a sub literate problem. It's just that it's a mark. Honestly, this I should be I think I'm Mark I'll change you know, it's it says 50 citizenship should it should ship kind of bullshit. It's crazy.

Alex 1:17:50
Oh, boy,

Merlin 1:17:51
that's a long acronym. But I think we could make it work s h i t. I shouldn't shouldn't that's a long acronym. But that's a lot of bottles

Max 1:18:02
cannot be I swear to God, this is written by a Markov chain generator that went to like a leadership course and got an MBA these goals cannot be they were proper. You know what, I think that one of the people who reported me for marijuana and college probably graduate probably took some sort of fucking leadership class, and now they sell this, they go down to town selling this program. These goals cannot be accomplished through the efforts of any one teacher, parent or institution, the responsibility for developing a nation of morally conscious students must be shared by all, only through shared commitment, can we hope to raise the level of character consciousness?

Alex 1:18:34
What the fuck? Well, those are words, it's drivel. It's true.

Merlin 1:18:40
You know what it is? It's like, it's like the thing that nobody is. It's like the secret that there's a secret that nobody tells you until you're old enough that you can't turn away from the life that you've already had. And that secret is that for most of your public schooling, you're going to learn how to stand in line and not problem pretty much everything you do up through a certain grade. Yeah, I mean, like the thing is, it's all it's just a series of different kind of like citizenship Turing tests to make sure that you are compliant. that's it that's that's that's what it is. And in this case, look at every one of these tell me I'm looking have a look at the right thing here. So you've got Oh my god, it's all the shit adults want you to think makes you successful in life. trustworthiness. Yeah, stand in line. Respect, respect, stand in line, responsibility. fairness. Well, it's only fair to stand in line. Karen. Karen has to stand in line and six citizenship. Stay in line. Just step out of line. what's what's number five, caring who care about do we care about getting out of line? No, I can't I can't wait to find you. What about sophistry? Self restraint What about your how's your citizenship? Check your citizenship game oh wait wait wait wait I can't wait I can't wait to buy a new one would you order what Jordan would you order?

Alex 1:19:53
Yeah, yeah, didn't you order what I

Max 1:19:54
did I've got the black I got the same one. I always get pinched. I did the black metal I think this marker of the black metal and it looks dope. It looks so cool

Merlin 1:20:01
metals that the water they burn churches in Sweden. Yeah,

Alex 1:20:05
yeah, I think so. midsummer. Did you get like a Milanese loop or

Max 1:20:09
I'm I love this. Oh, yeah. That's a sucker's game.

Merlin 1:20:13
You can always get aftermarket bands.

Alex 1:20:16
No. Well, my I think I've I'm going to pull a max and tell the story again. I have both Milanese loops because my mom bought them for me so because she didn't want me wearing a sports band at fancy of. I really really liked them. They're good little fidget

Merlin 1:20:33
Well, that's super passive aggressive mom. What killer character with

Alex 1:20:41
Merlin. What traits did you get?

Merlin 1:20:46
Whatever they told me to get I'm a goose and they'll feed me till they're done.

Max 1:20:53
I'm a little piggy.

Merlin 1:20:57
This feeds into a challenge idea that Oh, sorry.

Max 1:21:02
My NASA I'm a nasty little boy. I hope they step on me. I hope they make for pro phones this year. I hope every quarter there's a new profile

Merlin 1:21:12
screen if you hit me in the balls with a phone really hard it would hurt so much.

Max 1:21:18
Yeah, yeah, they've all got a strap down and they're just know and they're like look at the color gap. You have to have it and I do have to have

Merlin 1:21:30
