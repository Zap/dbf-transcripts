Oh boy. See, that was a more wholesome morning zoo. I actually don't know what the morning zoo is. I just know references to the morning zoo.

Unknown 0:56
Zoo was kind of invented in my metro area in the early 80s. Oh, really? The q zoo in the morning on cue 105

Unknown 1:06

Oh no, I need that show.

Unknown 1:28
Um, yeah. And so this guy Scott Shannon. Oh God I remember this Scott Shannon and Cleveland Wheeler. And they had the QZ in the morning and it was you know, by later standards very tame. It was just their morning drive time when I could do show and I and then Scott Shannon, I think if memory serves went on to do it in other markets. I don't know if they invented it, but I mean, he invented a radio show in the morning but then that turned into I mean, I think a lot of shock jock stuff kind of came out of that morning Zoo culture you didn't have growing up. No,

Unknown 2:02
I had a I had an iMac with CD. CDR that ripped rip CDs. That what it was CDR

Unknown 2:13

Although really was a baby. Oh no, I'm sorry now Jimmy you were job writer. What am I saying? Yeah, you like job breaker. Oh of course.

Unknown 3:52
saw them open for Meat Puppets and Stone Temple Pilots. Oh man, that would be much later probably

Unknown 3:59
that I truly don't know like every thing in that era is a blur just because I was on like live wire and getting I know get in all that.

Unknown 4:11
Oh my god. Yes. And it was it was God it was it was so interesting with Livewire I liked similar to and because ah. What was neat about them though, was I mean something I guess all you youths know now is that the more popular song was easier was to get. So you could find obscure stuff, but like if they turned off their computer or something you're like out of luck. If you want to Britney Spears, you're good to go. But so exciting. Yeah, what was I listening to? I was doing you know, I don't know if this is the show. It's just the pre show or the pre pre show

Unknown 4:41

Unknown 4:47
gotten good notes on the Alex and Merlin pre show which does need a name and a song probably probably listening to. Yeah, I was listening. I was going back and listening to have discovered so much good music lately.

Unknown 5:03

And sometimes I'll just go You know what, I need to just not look at Twitter in particular today because it was it was suicide day. And I was just like, I can't move in today. So what I do is I try to make a practice of saying I'm going to go on Spotify and I'm going to try to find new music and I will look like go listen to bands that my friends like that. I should try out I'll go I you know as you know I love going to fans also like section you know of a band and yeah, yeah, it's covered fish.

Unknown 6:07
Oh, oh my listen. Oh my.

Unknown 6:12

That was my first Well, my first concert was Dixie Chicks. But I don't remember it. So it doesn't count. That's before they were canceled yet before. Did they get can't? Oh, I remember. But yeah, it was one of those things where my aunt was just really into the Get up kids. And thought, you know, like this, Alex, and it was there. So cool. And it was their first farewell tour of like, four. Farewell Tour. That's all right.

Unknown 6:42
That's all right.

Unknown 6:42
But it was I mean, I don't know. I was like 14 and it was wild. That was when I was

Unknown 6:49
you must have been so you must have felt so cool to get to do that.

Unknown 6:54
No, I didn't know it was cool. I just thought I mean it was like this obscure band that I listened to on the internet. Really? I thought it was nerdy. Oh Max Max is here. Oh no deck of cards we've only just begun

Unknown 7:08
so if you like get up kids promise ring I like promise right? Oh,

Unknown 7:11

Unknown 7:13
So you you got a broad base in this because of the file sharing services? Yes.

Unknown 7:17

Unknown 7:26
pirating. And at the same time. That person now

Unknown 7:31
braid. I never got into braid. They were old school. Hey Max, how's it going buddy? Welcome to the show. From the internet science site, the morning zoo is a format of morning radio show common to English language radio broadcasting name is derived from the wackiness and Xenia so the activity segments and overall personality jumping down to history.

Good morning.

Unknown 8:09
Tampa strong

Unknown 8:15
guys think that Epstein was murdered

Unknown 8:20
show

Unknown 8:32
Oh, there All right, here we are.

Unknown 8:35
You guys need me for this one.

Unknown 8:36
Remember every every suicide slash murder joke, Stan, Stan, and

Unknown 8:42
Okay, that's your policy this week. Is it suicide? Murder? conspiracy. It's all okay, open the floodgates

Unknown 8:49
open open

Unknown 8:50
the floodgates, we're going full Epstein brain. This is

Unknown 8:53
something I thought of the other day and I think it's pretty problematic. But if I was a sad teen, and I heard about the Epstein suicide, and I wasn't into all the conspiracy theories, and I was in especially sad teen, I'd be like, Oh, man, that's not how I want to go, Oh, no, no, no, and cancel all dark plans. And I don't want to be remembered like this. I don't want a yearbook a page in the yearbook. If I'm associated with a pedophile? No, no, no. So really, I think that's why

Unknown 9:26
that's why when David Carradine died

Unknown 9:28
that I don't know. kung fu David.

Unknown 9:32
David Carradine. He liked a little bit of he liked to get in the chokey Oh like

Unknown 9:38
me that's what happened.

Unknown 9:42
Okay, all right.

Unknown 9:43
Could have Carradine himself a little bit well according

Unknown 9:45
to Matt there was nothing he could hang from or with in the cell according to Matt

Unknown 9:51
I'm not gonna say that I've seen wasn't murdered because he clearly was but also how do people I've heard I have heard that line if people go there was nothing for names off on that's a big talking point. Like how do you fuck the you know that like what do they know what the prison cell looks like? You know I mean, like

Unknown 10:06
why why would they put him in a place where there wasn't even a great supposedly he was put in a place where they took away all the tying things

Unknown 10:14
well well he but he wasn't on suicide watch that's the thing is they did put him in a place where he could kill him

Unknown 10:20

10s of thousands of people so scared of what has happened to Matt Chrisman and I don't want it to me I'm so worried that

Unknown 11:38
Yeah, it's like a Highlander situation.

Unknown 11:40
Yeah, really? I think a culture all every day.

Unknown 11:42
I am what am I taking so I'm I have gotten a sinus infection from all I travel. I was doing shit dog. I'm sorry. That's okay. It happens. Free all the time. And then I have

Unknown 11:54

Unknown 12:00

Unknown 12:07
And then and then I'm taking off I'm taking floor Aster

Unknown 12:12
brands with probiotic which is what the pharmacist at Walgreens recommended.

Unknown 12:18
greens, not just anyone. Okay, okay, Walker,

Unknown 12:21
fancy Walgreens, super Walgreens. a pharmacist recommended anything to me. I would slowly back away and go to the nearest

Unknown 12:30
that's just a form of judgment. Anytime a pharmacy. Have you tried deodorant?

Unknown 12:37
at the pharmacy? You know how hard it is to become a pharmacist? I do. Yes.

Unknown 12:40
Why? But

Unknown 12:43
what is becoming a mall lawyer?

Unknown 13:00
Is this legal or not legal?

Unknown 13:03
Everybody's

Unknown 13:08
talking about the one that's in the old bank. And no, actually, I have no idea. The one the one. That's an old bet. It's like the flagship Walgreens. The one on the corner.

Unknown 13:15
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

Unknown 13:17
And it's in an old bank and I don't and they've divided the bank vault is full of vitamins. It's called the vitamin vault. I don't think you get to work in the vitamin vault unless you're highly qualified.

Unknown 13:26
Make sense? Yeah.

Unknown 13:28
probably get special clearances for that.

Unknown 13:33
No, no, no, no, I take a lot of pills. But um, no, I don't I'm not sold on vitamins as a thing. Unless I mean, unless you have a you know what, who cares that we got to talk about you guys.

Unknown 13:49
I'm trying to get away from the suicide but let's let's go let's go into the murder. Let's go into how he didn't have anything in his cell supposed to shame and he was great.

Unknown 13:59
murdered by someone powerful or not. Hmm.

Unknown 14:03
And he's clearly a body double or not.

Unknown 14:06
I mean, obviously not he double stuff. Obviously a lot of really look at us here. Just look at his here. I'm

Unknown 14:11
a different here.

Unknown 14:14
Here's now that I've got some distance on it. And I've like read all the news. Perspective gets a perspective. Well, in the in the six hours after he was after he died, I was like, he was definitely murdered by the Clintons. Or, like, Am I six or something

Unknown 14:28
Barack Obama saw it could be massaged massage saw

Unknown 14:31
a lot of like, Listen, how many fucking powerful billionaires and state actors wanted this guy dead. I mean, probably the Saudis. The British royal family, like, like the

Unknown 14:42
Catholic has any former presidents. So that would want to he

Unknown 14:44
might have been he also might have been, I actually do really by the idea that maybe he had some sort of intelligence community. He was either like working for the CIA, or he was being used by them. Like, I think that's very, I think, all the other Listen, if you want that all the all the Picasso say, the thread is there, if you want, if you want to make a string board, it's line right there in front of you to pick up and connect them to the CIA, if that's if you want, but I also think it's possible that his life was really shitty, and he just killed himself. And and it just happened to be whatever all these powerful and rich people wanted. I don't know,

Unknown 15:20
if I have the most boring conspiracy theory, which is, you know, the guy is well connected. I'm told that me child rapists don't do that well in prison. And I think that is scary acts as friends who are ex billionaires would not have him go to a nice safe spot. So I can just see him paying a lot of money to a guards family and being like, hey, slipped me some hills, put some bruises on me and just just, you know, mingle. It wasn't Mengele,

Unknown 15:49
or who was the guy that killed himself the day before sensing and remember, was there a guy wasn't a guy that could found a sympathetic guard

Unknown 15:57
wasn't Milosevic. I don't.

Unknown 16:01
Milosevic,

Unknown 16:01
it might have been Milosevic. Yeah, most of it. I mean, I know the only people who go like only like, I don't know why people go to the ICC, but I know that like the one guy that they almost got on war crimes like his like Kiki, he managed to kill himself the day before his trial, but

Unknown 16:15
permeation

Unknown 16:17
Oh, I think I think this happened in Milosevic as well.

Unknown 16:21
Herman carrying Nazi potentate World War Two clicking clicking, clicking trial and death. Oh, they got a picture of him here. Here doesn't match though.

Unknown 16:33
made an appeal asking to be shot as a soldier. Oh, no, it was it was another It was another Bosnian Slobodan and he managed to take cyanide right before his racom lot of maybe he so Garen committed suicide with a testing cyanide capsule the night before he was to be hanged. Citation 138.

Unknown 16:50
Here's the thing. So I will go as far as team but you guys, you guys own this Epstein brain episode. That's fine. Here is the thing that I think is difficult to difficult to avoid, which is, there are so many super interesting lack of theories about this conspiracy or otherwise. But what it does come down to is something went fucking wrong. At some point, there's, there's no, there's no explanation for what happened here that has everybody coming out looking good. And I think what you said, Alex does make a lot of sense is that, you know, he might have done a Gehring, and he did the Gary.

Unknown 17:30
Apparently, he was walking around, I saw this in some news article that he was apparently walking around the prism, asking random inmates for their like, ID number, and then just putting money in their commissary. So he was literally just walking around and just giving people cash. And the idea, I assume, like why would you do that? It's just to say like, Hey, don't don't kill me.

Unknown 17:51
This was more where this came from.

Unknown 17:52
There's there's more of this for your family. If you slip me a cyanide pill. I listen, I don't like that billionaires who, in general, and I really don't like billionaires who abused children. And I feel like there are people with a lot.

Unknown 18:09
I know, break hold stance and

Unknown 18:11
millionaires who abused children more because at least you're good. You know, at least you're doing something cool. Yeah. Do you know the TD assist

Unknown 18:17
to be that rich?

Unknown 18:18
Yeah, you should like I mean, you shouldn't do something you should have some sort of like James Bond level. Yeah. A lot of billionaires when they get rich and they do the schemes from the bad Bond movies like Do you remember the one where the guy His goal was he owned a newspaper and then he was going to start a war to print more newspapers know lame It was a Pierce Brosnan. Why you

Unknown 18:39
don't you don't deserve a volcano with a plan

Unknown 18:41
and pierce Pierce Brosnan pushes in the end put Pierce Brosnan kicks him into the printing press and he goes I guess I'll print anything these days. My God

Unknown 18:50
extra extra Read all about it.

Unknown 18:58
And now what a lot of billionaires do but I think if I was a billionaire I think I would do some

Unknown 19:04
would you get weird max Do you think you would you would get so you'd maybe start out with charity projects?

Unknown 19:08
Oh I would do something I would I'd be I'd be doing I'd be dipping girls into gold. I'd have some weird stuff going on and then the Needham

Unknown 19:17
is that what he did? I don't know I mean people like Coldplay to food you could probably get that on like a bagel or something. I see it here's what I see.

Unknown 19:22
I see you do I would definitely capture I would definitely capture a spy and smash his testicles. I mean, that's number one.

Unknown 19:30
And then there'd be a really crummy looking Xerox of your Amazon order of your ball smashing toilet or

Unknown 19:38
how to train a slave and how to break a ball

Unknown 19:42
I think you know I could see you max I mean you you do pretty well in life but I see you going to Zuckerberg route or like there's everything around here is named after a Silicon Valley person like the General Hospital is now like the Mark Zuckerberg hospital and there's you know and then you know you hear this you hear the you know the evidence Sarah Williams foundation or the Eric Schmidt and founding all these I see you starting a foundation and then you move I see you moving into more of a mosque and I see you getting into some very very strange projects like I don't know buying an island or digging a large hole. Something really deranged making the camp play a podcast.

Unknown 20:15
Unless you got the right outfit.

Unknown 20:18
Games in your driveway,

Unknown 20:20
but then you should get weird man, you should get weird and you should have Steven Pinker hanging out and go That's very interesting. OUY that's, that's a sex farm and we're gonna freeze your dick.

Unknown 20:32
All right. The story checks out.

Unknown 20:34
No, I you know what? Respect like he he got a bunch of money. And then he did all the weird stuff he could think of

Unknown 20:39
No, no, not gone, retracting that statement. And we're

Unknown 20:44
Tell me everything you know about the temple. What's it called?

Unknown 20:48
Oh, I just know. It's like from Google. I mean, I've probably heard the same podcasts you have. But it's from like Google Images. And he's got this weird golden dome on his shit.

Unknown 20:57
And then it was damaged wasn't a damaged by a storm. Yeah,

Unknown 21:00
the hurricane blew it off. And well, that was something else. The dome, I think the thing that got damaged in the hurricane was like an acoustical chamber for a piano. I don't know, man.

Unknown 21:12
So what's your theory? Matt? Bring the rockets. What's going on? What do you think happened?

Unknown 21:17
I Well, I'm I'm I really have to say like, I'm torn between two theories, and neither of them are great. And the first one is that the first one is the more fun one to believe, which is that there's a satanic cabal of child predators at the highest levels of power, including the presidency. And they do like ritualistic child abuse, and human trafficking as a way to like indicate each other into the ruling class and the billionaire class. And it's basically a True Detective season one, but they're in charge of every facet of our lives. And when and then that, that, that that's in a lot of ways, the more fun one to believe. And, you know, listen, like conspiracy theories are having a moment like culturally right now. Don't you think everyone's got some sort of conspiracy theory?

Unknown 22:00
I do. I do. I think I think in times, where everybody on every part of the political cultural spectrum has things that are difficult to impossible to understand. In the absence of evidence about why things are so strange for everybody. We cobbled together the suspicions and evidence, quote, unquote, that we can find that it ends up becoming like a conspiracy theory. And I think everybody does. If you see if you think fucking liberals don't do this, holy shit, we're so deep on this stuff. It's

Unknown 22:30
human nature, right? People who just haven't branded it as well as QM, think because people know no one wants to think of everything around them as as as basically as a contingent, that's what I'm thinking of. And so like, going like, people always have something of like, oh, there was an eclipse because like, God is angry at us, like people always come up with some, yeah, order to basically random noise that they can understand. And things feel very crazy and out of control right now. So I think

Unknown 22:55
forever, but for everybody, it feels easy for the guy who lost his job at GM to,

Unknown 23:00
but it feels even I think even for Trump, right? Who's the most powerful guy in the world? He's out there tweeting conspiracy theories, because they give him a sense of order to his worldview as well. So I think it's I think we live in in very uncertain times, and conspiracy theories, even if it's bad, even if it's like, oh, this evil cabal of Jews control every facet of my life, and they're there personally gang stalking me or whatever. But at least it's someone's in charge. You know what I mean? At least there is an order

Unknown 23:26
it tickets, but it's a to have a half conspiracy that catches on there. There's two parts that have to work together. I think, I'm not a scholar of this. But first, there has to be malevolence, there has to be somebody who's deliberately doing something to screw with you and yours in particular, but then there also has to be secrecy and cover ups, that it's not just malevolence, there also has to be connections between malevolent people that you are not supposed to know about.

Unknown 23:50
Well, a big part of it is that it can't be falsifiable. So anything that comes out, that's evidence against your conspiracy theory, you have to be able to take it and turn it and you go, No, that's part of it. They did that. No proof. It's just more proof. Right, exactly. False Flag. Yeah. Okay. So on the one hand, I think you have like, True Detective season one. And on the other hand, I think basically, you have Jeffrey Epstein, who was doing an extortion ring with with human trafficking, do it and trap billionaires into giving him money for his

Unknown 24:20
thick hedge fund for his fake hedge fund.

Unknown 24:24
I don't even I mean, that's not even a conspiracy theory, a

Unknown 24:25
power of attorney,

Unknown 24:26
we basically know that to be true, I think I think that's pretty safe, that we could say that that's more or less what his operation was. And, and then, well, it's not that everyone was in on it. And it's not that everyone was a pedophile, and there wasn't, you know, it's just that a lot of that can just be explained by the fact that there is this small group of people at the top of like, political leaders, rich people, billionaires, a social elites like science, elite, elite people in science, and they all just hang out with each other. And they have that, you know, the, in the, in the in among the sort of ruined classic, it's a pretty small social group. And everybody visits each other's islands, and they all hang out. And and so if Epstein has a lot of weird stuff going on, anybody can be tied to him who's in that class, because they all flew in his plane, they all went to his Island, they all hang out together. They're all photographed at parties with each other. You know what I mean? It doesn't mean that we're all doing satanic child abuse. I mean, I like I actually don't know, like, maybe they were, but I'm just, I'm just trying to that that's the more moderating, like, common sense thing that I'm trying to hang on.

Unknown 25:33
Do you think that he was murdered by somebody? Let's leave that for a minute whether it was Hillary Clinton. Yeah, I was.

Unknown 25:40
When it broke. I was 100%. Sure. I was like, it's all true. Pizza gate was true. It's all real. And now I've read and I've, yeah, I had this moment I had Veronica will tell you like I went insane. And there

Unknown 25:51
was a few hours. So So Alex, this is the point when I went on to Spotify to go find new emails. Because I was like, wait a minute, this is with the tweet, storm. This is all just seeming a little too plausible. There's nothing there's nothing sane. That's plausible. And there's nothing insane. That's impossible. And I need to walk away from Twitter, because I'm going to turn into Matt Chrisman if I'm not careful.

Unknown 26:12
I bet both Veronica and Maddie were just like, they probably just walked, both walked away from us. And we're like, now now because I may be an hour of this. And then I was like, I gotta I gotta stop. I gotta stop. And but him it's,

Unknown 26:27
it's him in particular. He's such a cipher. At this point. We know, what we know about him is, I would say uniformly weird, terrible. Incomplete, right? Like, it's just, it's just the heat. He is already a cipher for so much of the boogeyman stuff,

Unknown 26:45
I think in 30 years, or 50 years or whatever, all this Epstein shit will have the same cultural prominence as area 51. And the Kennedy assassination.

Unknown 26:56
I wouldn't be surprised. I would not be surprised at all,

Unknown 26:58
it's going to go down as one of those big ones that there's lots of

Unknown 27:00
if maybe more than JFK,

Unknown 27:02
lots of la culture. And you know what I mean? And like, like, TV episode ripped from the headlines, like TV episodes? Yeah.

Unknown 27:12
The reason I don't think that is because I think there's a lot of people like Epstein, and it's still gonna happen, and there

Unknown 27:20
are a lot of people like how,

Unknown 27:23
what do you mean? How? Like, there are a lot

Unknown 27:26
of pedophiles? Are you familiar with what happened? In a well known Christian church over the last hundred years? On the one hand, go, Wow, I've always been creeped out by my clergyman, he sure seems weird. How did you discover Oh, boy, everybody's whispering about this weird thing that happened. At that point. You're like, this fucking sucks. That sucks. But we haven't even gotten to the what's the what's the movie about that with the hawk?

Unknown 27:50
spotlight. And that's the sad part. Yeah,

Unknown 27:53
you get the spotlight stuff. And you discover the deliberate, it was a conspiracy. There was a deliberate you that you would move these clergy people to different churches where they go and repeat exactly their same actions slap on the wrist, and it went all the way up to Vatican City. It was it was in that sense, truly a conspiracy to cover something up amongst the people who you would most hope you could trust your kids to be around. And like they covered up for all of the people who covered up for all the people who cover it up for all the people. It was it was cover ups all the way up.

Unknown 28:26
And the most fucked up thing, not the most productive thing. But so many kids, you hear about kids being paid off and stuff like that. But there were so many kids just telling their parents telling the other priests they could trust like, this guy crossing out, or this guy screwed up assaulted me, and then it was cover up after cover up after cover up. And that's why I think if you're a billionaire, it's got to be easier to cover that up. Because it you know, there's, I don't know, there there are still some people in the Catholic church who believe that it's all you know, like, it's either lefties trying to, you know, legalize abortion, and just all of this just nastiness the

Unknown 29:11
same persecution we've been facing since the time of Paul,

Unknown 29:14
right? Basically, it's, it's, it's bonkers. And if you're not gonna listen to your actual child, are you going to listen to some sex worker who's like, ah, actually, they took my younger sister on a jet to an island because that sounds fucking crazy.

Unknown 29:31
Well, and then the part that we're the Max Max is talking about that, like we have, we are kidding about this horrible thing or joking about it, but like, look at Oh, my God, look at so many people who are, there's so much self destruction wound up in so many of these powerful people. And we've always thought that about Bill Clinton, before he was elected, he was doing incredibly self destructive stuff, he was doing stuff that any rational person would not do. Because you know, you're gonna get caught at that. But he kept doing it. And he kept going and kept doing that. And you look at somebody, like, imagine a system where you are hiring underage girls. I wish we could get away from that phrase sexual erotic massage, you guys should say, and it's really gross. But like so. But part of the system, the part where this gets even more harrowing is that you're now you're supposed to go out and recruit your friends. And they tell two friends and so on and so on. And you have this hand job pyramid scheme, that it's such a horrifying idea to even contemplate. But like I mentioned how reckless you would have to be to assume that that would never get out. You would have to be so fucking deranged. I mean, this is the same guy who wanted his head and Dick frozen.

Unknown 30:39
You'd have to be anthony wiener basically.

Unknown 30:41
Well, yeah, but don't but like, at a certain point, like maybe I mean, I've seen let me pause this I don't think he was like a smart man. I don't think he was like got like a like a like even hearing all the like all the scientists like dunk on him now and say that he didn't understand any of this stuff there. You know what I'm talking about? Like, he really comes across? Oh, yeah.

Unknown 31:01
We all thought it was a weirdo. I drank his free drinks and I flew in his plane and I nodded along but I always thought he was alone. Well, and they all have like specific anecdotes of like really dumb, like shit that he said or times that he anyway, he was just he was not a smart dude. And he had apparently had a lot of trouble like focusing and would just do this and there was a one anecdote where like, there was a dinner where it was all like models on one side and pop science people on the other and he would keep oscillating his attention between like and you know, asking the the Malcolm Gladwell type person about dick freezing and asking the woman over here to rub his shoulders and just holding court. I mean that that's deranged.

Unknown 31:38
That sounds pretty cool. I could get into that.

Unknown 31:41
That's like blaming mass shooters for having a mental illness. Like it's not that he seemed to have a weird sexual add type thing is that he was a billionaire who liked kids. Oh, yeah. sounds terrible. I know what sexual add. No, no.

Unknown 31:59
Alex, the only point I'm bringing this up is I was gonna say I don't think I've seen is very smart. And I think he did corrupt enough very, very powerful people into his extortion ring, that he maybe he really did think it would never get out. Maybe he's like, you know what, we're too big to fail. Like I like there's too many powerful. Yeah, many people who all like own media companies, like I do think at a certain point, like, maybe he was just diluted.

Unknown 32:20
No, I mean, so so your official what's your official what's your official current as we and you know, by the time we're done recording, we're going to be fucked. You know, there's going to be something funny, I know. I'm going

Unknown 32:30
to say I was I was very fired up about all the conspiracy theory stuff. And I was like, it's like a Satanist cabal, and, you know, whatever. And they're all working for the CIA and fucking children. And now I'm like, more like Schrodinger as cat of like, I could, we as we get more information, I'm

Unknown 32:49
either something totally plausible, or something totally insane, or

Unknown 32:52
just completely,

Unknown 32:54
almost equally ready to believe either one, depending on what comes down the pipeline, like I really could, like it wouldn't if it turns out that there is some crazy satanist thing that comes out. It wouldn't shock me, I'd be like, yeah, that is supported by everything we know. But also, if it turns out to be more mundane, and it was just kind of a bunch of dumb, rich people who got extorted. And there there isn't a sort of broader, major political conspiracy behind it. I would also just believe it. And also there's another possibility, which is we'll never find out another fact about it. And what we know is what we know and this is the end of it. And I would also believe that and I'd be like, yep, just going to be one of those. We're just going to get you know, Epstein blue balls for the rest of our life.

Unknown 33:36
Alex, what's yours? I got I got I want to tell mine but tell me tell me

Unknown 33:40
as we recorded 1137 Central Time on Wednesday, August 14, what is your theory on the on the legend? Suicide of Epstein

Unknown 33:49
Occam's razor. He was a disgusting man who was a coward and he killed himself because he was afraid of his rich friends and being in prison.

Unknown 34:01
That's so rational. Yeah, my mind is mine is

Unknown 34:05
I gotta I've gotta I gotta show it and yours child molester to. One is one is, however it came to be. He took his own life in his cell that Friday night and you know, we can get into the salt and pepper thing of like how that was able to happen. So I think was either that exactly what they said happened. Or the previous quote unquote suicide attempt in which he was taken away and taken to a hospital. That's when they switched him with the homeless man.

Unknown 34:37
Oh, he hasn't it hasn't been Epstein

Unknown 34:41
or, or it's like the movie widows. And it was just a bunch of pissed off moms you like, Oh, alright, I've changed my it's

Unknown 34:50
not impossible that somehow he got like, Look, can we just pause that that's not as kooky as it sounds like it like if there was CIA involvement, like they've done kooky stuff like this all the time.

Unknown 35:02
There are dumber QN on theories to be sure. You're much dumber QN on the ear thing, like I don't know. But like, I, here's the thing, there's a reason there's a reason that they would not get him down, which is that he has all of the resources even if he's not the billionaire he claims to be he appears to have something like at least like like half half a billion dollars in resources. He does seem to have a lot of powerful friends. If there is of the people that I'm aware of. If there's anybody who has the means. It's an opportunity, the resources to do some fucking shenanigans. It's Jeffrey goddamn Epstein. I that part I do believe. Was he killed by a surrogate for Clinton? I don't know. I don't think probably.

Unknown 35:51
I don't think that the Clintons lack the operational competence to do it heavy to effective.

Unknown 35:59
Yeah, they don't know. Know, they could scrape a wet dream.

Unknown 36:02
I mean, here's what I'll say. If it

Unknown 36:03
was if he was an iMac in a basement. He

Unknown 36:06
was assassinated. It was like very clean, because we don't know. You know what I mean? Like they didn't get Boston on the assassination. And I it was pretty good. Like, it seems like it was like a state actor,

Unknown 36:17
but it had to be so desperate to do it in this way. This This is such a ham fisted way to assassinate somebody. I mean, you know, I've seen a lot of Mission Impossible movies. There's all kinds of things you can do to people but like for this particular thing, this is if that was the case. Jesus Christ. There's so many loose ends here.

Unknown 36:34
How would How would you have killed him?

Unknown 36:36
Oh, I would I would go in with a with a bowie knife made of ice.

Unknown 36:41
Hmm. Oh, boring.

Unknown 36:44
It's dead stabbing in the dick.

Unknown 36:45
The doctor was his mother. Morning.

Unknown 36:49
But Doctor I

Unknown 37:25

Yeah. So here's what I do alkaloids. 10 and then I have little and Merlin do remember many episodes ago you recommended a product that are these clear pill baggies that you can label with a sharpie just just refilled mine last night and so I carry so I figured out the most efficient way to fit a variety of pills and powders into my backpack as I haven't had one of those metal alkaloids tins the large one not the minis and it's and then in their sub sub organ

Unknown 43:41
that holds all your pills

Unknown 43:43

Unknown 45:03
point is I really like the Screen Cleaner is the one where it's two pads you have a wet and dry Oh Yeah, that'll fucking get the job done. Would you recommend a screen clean with a K?

Unknown 45:14
Yeah, I'll find it that's a good fucking product. Oh, if I had my Tom beanbag, I would know exactly what it's called. But unfortunately I'm using this

Unknown 45:23

I realized that I have the same hotel similar setup to grey in that the left pouch is all human needs and the right pouch is all like Cyborg needs oh that's such a good way to

Unknown 46:16
end it's really good

Unknown 46:17

Unknown 46:26

Unknown 46:28
Oh gosh. But you know it's basically

Unknown 46:33

Unknown 46:37
person Oh God. Oh wow. And you know what, you know, the middle the middle not just big enough for water bottle but but not just big enough for kindle but I can fit a physical book in there as well as my 12 or my 11 inch iPad and my 13 inch MacBook Pro that

Unknown 46:56
that middle the middle water bottle so that was the thing I love about this Tom been like synapse bag is it has this long pouch running on the outside straight down the middle front. So it's like the the front spine of the bag and it's designed for you to put like one of those like sports water bottles in but let me tell you what I carry in there. I've got one of those big, big anchor batteries. Like Jim.

Unknown 47:21
Yeah, I just bought a new long boy. It's like six or eight inches long.

Unknown 47:24
Yes, it might. Yeah, exactly. It's very heavy. I mean, you could kill a rat with this thing if you had to.

Unknown 47:28
Do you're talking about Yeah, like the reverse Iron Man. back? Yes.

Unknown 47:32
Yeah, exactly. And I have that I do not feel comfortable. Like I can't like unclench my bottle. Unless I have that on my person and it's fully full of juice. And I can run my laptop off of that. I can charge my phone many many times. Like, you know, you could get through a whole international flight with that connected your iPad. Like it really is like our bank.

Unknown 47:52
Merlin has just sent us a photograph of his pillow

Unknown 47:55
was meant to be seen in this serial order.

Unknown 47:58
Can I get which one each is?

Unknown 48:02
Um, I don't know. Okay, first one is my north face. Mini duffel bag that I highly recommend. They're really good. They're a little overpriced, but I swear by them I use them to like,

Unknown 48:12
Oh, these are I just saw the pills but you've got all of your stuff here. Okay, thank you.

Unknown 48:17
Yeah, so then the second one what's not supposed to be known here? Yeah, so I got a one terabyte SSD with movies on it. Like afford a hotel room when watch movies and plug it in? The guy that's like a cultural Claritin. The pen max told me about identity pen my backup air pods yubikey yubikey and then the bag of drugs yubikey had a pretty bad I got the replacement. I have

Unknown 48:41
to replace mine. Yeah.

Unknown 48:43
And then there's the drugs there's the drugs somebody's got some herbals you got some non herbals I couldn't fit all that I have to have a very very comically

Unknown 48:52
Well, that's the thing, get a cube live

Unknown 48:55
and but I just realized I don't have any Imodium in here. I'm going commando and didn't even know now.

Unknown 49:00
Can you can you explain the you mentioned the Atlantic pen several times on the podcast. You give me the like elevator pitch for it. I mean, I carry a sharpie and a thin Sharpie. Sure. I need an old Sharpie and a young Sharpie.

Unknown 49:12
So things to know about the pen. First of all it is a thick and thin Sharpie and one. So look at that pen. It has a cap on either end. One is a sharpie size on the right side and the one the left side is fine. It's also a super like it's almost like a space pen for markers. This is what people use the same fucking golf balls. Like you can write on almost anything with this and it doesn't smear. And it's Japanese. I

Unknown 49:38
don't think I can use this for my magic purpose. Okay, okay.

Unknown 49:42
Is it to to permanent?

Unknown 49:44
No, it's that.

Unknown 49:46
Here's the thing. Don't Don't give me any trade secrets

Unknown 49:49
if you're not a trade secret, okay, if you're doing a magic trick, if I was doing a magic trick and I took out an identity pen and I said sign the card and then the sign card is like goes into my pocket or whatever the trick is. People would go

Unknown 50:01
let me step Oh, cuz it's not a sharpie. They're gonna think it's a magic monkey pen or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

Unknown 50:07
I am telling you. I'm telling you. It's crazy. Like I had a jet at Gen Con. I hurt my finger. I had like a hangnail on my index finger. And I had to keep putting my hand in my pocket. And I Black Swan my whole finger. Oh, the skin came all the way past my hand came all the way up my finger up your first knuckle, past the hand to the elbow and then peeled off of my ear.

Unknown 50:39
Rip of skin that exposes an entire nerve. Yeah,

Unknown 50:45
it was the one of the most painful things

Unknown 50:49
I keep thinking to yourself I wonder if this is done. It's not done. No. No.

Unknown 50:56
And it was so bad.

Unknown 51:01
I tried to get it in one big pieces

Unknown 51:02
anybody? Does anybody have 60 bad days?

Unknown 51:07
So I went to I found our first aid kit and i and i and i put a bandaid on and then I was doing magic for people all weekend. And every time I would do trick they go what's up with that band aid that's fucking hangnail. I mean, that's the deal is like you can't it's like you I've learned it's every little detail matters. Like you don't want to give anyone you don't want to give any more people to people anywhere to hide, right like it's got him. Everything's got to be aboveboard. Yeah,

Unknown 51:33
no, that makes sense. Yeah, Sharpies good because people instantly recognize a sharpie that makes sense. But I recommend get your get your pack of identity pens, you can get a four pack of four different colors and just try them out. And once you use it, it's really great for your just to go to marker it is it's super permanent. So keep that in mind, but it's real good.

Unknown 51:50
Cool. All right. What else? Do you guys have a flashlight that you're happy with? And yes, do you carry that in your bag?

Unknown 51:57
No. What do you like Marlon?

Oh my god. I have to tell me which one which one do I want? Well,

Unknown 53:39
here's here's one that I this is my little carry one. I might have learned about this from LR from pardon me from Marco. Try Fenix LD 12 lethal dose 12 lethal dose No no, it's LD but that's that's a to pharmaceuticals. FENX What does it say? FENIXLD 12. I want to say Wow, look at that guy. I feel like I learned about this from Marco. This is the one I keep clipped to the outside of my very, very, very, very, very large Tom Van brain bag. back. And it's great. It's a it's a it's light. It's you know, it's it's a flashlight. It weighs something. But this is a great it's not too heavy flashlight.

Unknown 54:15
Have you ever used this? Or? Well, I should say

Unknown 54:18
yeah, I use it. I use it fairly often. Like once you've got it's like it's like becoming that guy. The sound guy at the bar who has all this shit on his belt. We're like you know, once you have a space pen, you start writing stuff down. Once you have a flashlight like you will be amazed how many times you are glad you have a flashlight.

Unknown 54:35
Now the one that the one that I have that I enjoy is a I made it I think I talked about this on the show before we've talked about everything on the show before but it's a little it's a little torch like it comes out of its sheath. And, and it's like a lamp like

Unknown 54:49
a toxins penis. Yeah, yeah.

Unknown 54:53
So it's a normal flashlight. But then you can also click on it and it comes out like a lightsaber. And it's like a lantern.

Unknown 55:00
crystals are pretty expensive.

Unknown 55:05
flashlight. What else? What

Unknown 55:07
else? Yes. What do you guys have? Do you have any

Unknown 55:11
tools or implements in there?

Unknown 55:13
I have the Kershaw that Merlin gifted me.

Unknown 55:17
Wait, you can't travel with that. No, I'll never put a knife in my backpack. Because I fucking know that I'll try I'll forget it there and bring it through TSA by accident.

Unknown 55:25
I do a clean sweep every time I travel. Like along with my travel list is also my don't travel I have to

Unknown 55:33
write well that's and that to me, that's another use of one of these little mini doubles is that's where I have stuff like I've got a really nice leather man. I got a wine opener. Anything Goes kind of like cause me trouble. I don't carry a wine opener. You think you're better than

Unknown 55:48
me? Are you No no, no, no, no, I think I actually carry a beer thing because just because of time one of my key chains but why did you just become wine opener guy as well wash my car.

Unknown 56:01
When travel I like wine.

Unknown 56:03
I'm sorry.

Unknown 56:04
I'm gonna send you a link to my flashlights Google Sheet. I had to eventually bring it in from out of markdown. So you can see here which was put out the the most wattage how many milliamp hours the type of battery a URL for purchasing it. And some of the various things I hope that's useful to you.

Unknown 56:24
Oh, it's destroyed me.

Unknown 56:28
No, I don't actually own a flash course.

Unknown 56:35
Own a flashlight of a spreadsheet. Not like a spreadsheet for everything I do. Not a weirdo. Not like I tracked historic prices ephedrine or compare the price of

Unknown 56:45
five different vendors.

Unknown 56:48
Not weird.

Unknown 57:00
Now I've got the dawn but now the final one is on the bottom of the backpack on the Tom Ben. That's where the dongles live. So I've got what's in there. I've got my air pods. I've

Unknown 57:10
got all the way down there. Yeah, yeah, well, when I might have my top Zippy boy or my right pocket,

Unknown 57:16
the tops of people is for magic tricks now.

Unknown 57:18
So it's been

Unknown 57:20
so the air pods have been downgraded, but also like I don't use the air pods too often because when I travel now I do the I have my over the year noise cancelling headphones so nice. So nice to know I'm on the Bose quiet comfort 35 I think they have better sound quality and better noise cancelling for my, to my taste and then more comfortable there better all around

Unknown 57:42
emollient DN 35

Unknown 57:43
that's what I'm looking at right now. That's a bright flashlight, so

Unknown 57:47
you might need to go into some different batteries. You know, it's baller though is some of these come with a USB back on the actually the Fenix might be one of these. It comes with a weird little battery that has a USB or rather a USB mini port in it. So you can charge the battery without needing an intermediary device. That's cool. Can you go look this up? Yeah, this is one Oh, yeah, check the shit out like I send you a photo this this is so badass.

Unknown 58:10
I've got air pods I've got that little adapter for the iPhone. That's that's lightning to a pinch because like I've actually don't i don't know that I've ever used that but it takes up no space and I'm always concerned that I might Oh, you're gonna need it.

Unknown 58:22
I mean, I have a little hanging mushy bag where I keep my what's the thing to make your iPad connect to your Mac that I advertise on my shows? Do one of those see the lightning know the fucking what's called the company that makes the thing where you can throw your your Mac screen to Luna display I've got my lunar display in there that thing's comically small. It's really cool. That I've got one of those Yeah, I've got all the little baby dongles, the like all the annoyance dongles, like you know you're going to be in a rental car and it's not going to have a thing and you're going to want the little dingus like I keep all those there.

Unknown 58:58
Yeah, I've become the US PC and lightning to eighth inch I'm fully I'm fully switched over I'm completely migrated under the sort of tri part USB two

Unknown 59:11
oh the the Belkin

Unknown 59:12
one of those is so great yeah, I'm fully migrated over so my bag is full of them

Unknown 59:16
don't get a chippy I when you first told me about this I bought a GP don't get the GP get get a Belkin because you now have something that will charge describe this to people because this has been a game changer for me.

Unknown 59:27
So it's a little it's like a little Hydra and so on one and it's got your normal USB and then on the other it's got USB mini but then it's got little caps attached to it that go to lightning or USB see. So what I just have one of these in my backpack with my battery and from my that I can plug it into my phone, my iPad, my iPhone or my computer, or any of the various little micro USB shifts that right around my back.

Unknown 59:55
All right, so I'm gonna have to give me a link to this because one I want it to for show notes. What a Belkin I have the cheap it's

Unknown 1:00:05

Unknown 1:00:11
What else do I have in there? Oh, I've got the pod Alex, that thing that we found out about the sound guys, DMCA. And so it's a eighth inch two XLR adapter and I want up this thing I use this thing all if you do public speaking a lot which which sadly I do. You use this all the fucking time because you'll show up at venues and you'll go I need sound to come out of my computer on the go. All we have is XLR and you go, you know and their solution used to be what if you hold the microphone up?

Unknown 1:00:39
Yes. We'll get a direct boss got a nice deep bass. Oh

Unknown 1:00:45
no, this is a little it's a little in line. It just looks like a cable. It's very magical. And it does all the conversion and everything right in there.

Unknown 1:00:52
Belkin universal cable with micro USB, USB C and lightning connectors.

Unknown 1:00:56
Oh yeah. I have a cheapie of this in my bag to

Unknown 1:00:59
get the nice one. Because the thing is, if you travel in my case, I was traveling with it. And suddenly the SPC just wasn't working. So yeah, I would I would pop and look at it a little cool battery. See my battery? Isn't that from the future?

Unknown 1:01:12
That's really that's really futuristic and cool.

Unknown 1:01:15
Yeah, it's got a was that a mini right USB mini? Yeah. Yeah, pretty bad out.

Unknown 1:01:20
I've managed to eliminate. I'm I do have some stuff that's USB mini but that's the only one I have now. I used to have micro in Mini.

Unknown 1:01:31
Oh my god.

Unknown 1:01:32
What if What if Jeffrey Epstein had a Belkin universal cable in a cell

Unknown 1:01:36
data? anybody thought about that? That's

Unknown 1:01:38
what happened. It's the USB standards. Oh my god, he had

Unknown 1:01:43
a charging mishap he had he had an obscene

Unknown 1:01:53
heat accumulates with the energy,

Unknown 1:01:55
whatever app like the SD card from their laptops. Everyone's like kill myself myself.

Unknown 1:02:03
I can't go on.

Unknown 1:02:15
Challenge it's the most important challenge we've ever done before. I think I spoke

Unknown 1:02:28
this week's challenge was just to play Pokemon GO favorite one of my favorite video games of all time.

Unknown 1:02:35
We exhaust the topic of what's in our backpack.

Unknown 1:02:37
Oh my gosh, well, it until Mr. Bell

Unknown 1:02:41
what other what other cables and adapters? Do you guys

Unknown 1:02:43
save it for the after show?

Unknown 1:02:45
Yeah, find out what's in Merlin's bag you

Unknown 1:02:49
find out max you

Unknown 1:02:50
support the Dubai Friday Patreon Well, we the only way we make any money to continue doing this show there's no ads or that nonsense. We're not selling you that that thing that makes your thing go on iPad or none of that stuff. We're

Unknown 1:03:02
not telling you to get Mr. Ben products. No, no, no,

Unknown 1:03:04
no, no, you're never going to hear an ad on this podcast. And we're just a listener supported so that we can and you know what? Here's the other thing I think a lot All right. How about this? I think a lot of the podcasts out there that talk about Apple and backpacks on that kind of thing. I don't think they're gonna be wildly speculating about child predator Jeffrey Epstein and how he was murdered. By the clinton crime family.

Unknown 1:03:24
You won't see all the illegal you don't get that all in one place. You won't hear Federico VTG speculating about how a child molester died.

Unknown 1:03:30
Now I'm not going to get a ya know, why is that? It's because they're powered by their corporate overlords. Okay. You can't talk about how Jeffrey Epstein was murdered by Hillary Clinton and she was wearing she was wearing like a like a cat burglar outfit. Yeah,

Unknown 1:03:45
yeah, you're not gonna hear him. You're not gonna hear your voice on a TP talk about that.

Unknown 1:03:52
tiptoeing around like the Riddler

Unknown 1:03:53
and why Casper wouldn't have given them an ad afterwards.

Unknown 1:03:57
Okay. Got a mattress

Unknown 1:03:59
Epstein latex,

Unknown 1:04:00
limbo. Oh god clear history clear history.

Unknown 1:04:05
You're not reading a I simply say fat after you talk about how the MI six up killed a child predator reputation to Prince Andrew.

Unknown 1:04:16
You're not going to hear about how the twin bed inside of a virgin Island church was used for children. You're not you're not you're not going to hear that on pod save America or another pod

Unknown 1:04:24
know so and and that's why we can't talk about that is that there's no advertisers. And it's just we get to wildly speculate about any sort of reckless conspiracy theories that we want without any supporting evidence. And that's because we have no advertisers.

Unknown 1:04:39
Not even

Unknown 1:04:44
the only people we do answer to our $5 backers give us your fucking money calm. So if you go to give us your money, com you give us $5 a month you become one of our What is it? Our Cox's cocktail powder nation that's powder nation members and you get access to our after show where we will continue to wildly speculate about child predators. This week on the after show, Merlin will finally reveal all of the cables in his bag. And I think we might even get into a little bit of Benji's talk because I think Merlin, right, you never know. If you want to hear Merlin's take on Benji's. He had some very controversial things to say about I know that I know we're all over Jeffrey Epstein. But where do you guys who are Merlin has to say about Avengers, and you're gonna have to sign up it's $5 a month to give us your fucking money calm. And if you sign up for $10 a month. What do you get? You go

Unknown 1:05:34

Unknown 1:05:46
people we will reveal the truth of how Jeffrey Epstein really

Unknown 1:05:54
don't please don't share the links do not share the links.

Unknown 1:05:57
Yeah, yeah, don't do that. Don't do that. No, we'll talk about it later. But it's really really cool.

Unknown 1:06:02
All right, we're gonna do our challenge most important challenge

Unknown 1:06:04
we've ever had the most important challenge this challenge comes from Alex Cox and it's moved to play Pokemon GO Did anybody play Pokemon? I know max did at some point. Oh, what level are you at?

Unknown 1:06:17
babbling Kim rocket right

Unknown 1:06:20
now. Right now I'm on goal bat and my Dragon Knight is not doing great right now. Come on, buddy. Yeah, yeah, so Merlin you're not a fan of games of games. Fun you hate games. You hate her my lovely Pocket Monsters

Unknown 1:06:41
What did you did? Did you play the game and what did you think about it?

Unknown 1:06:45
My whole family has been playing Pokemon Go for a week

Unknown 1:06:54
yeah, yeah no everybody everybody's in so I'm at five Madeline is it 5am I is that level Oh yeah.

Unknown 1:07:00
yeahs. Oh, yeah. Oh my gosh, that means we can trade in battle. Yes.

Unknown 1:07:06
I mean, it's only been it's only rate stop on one of these pop ups. Okay, okay, stop. A raid battle is going to start nearby. Swype. Um, so Yes, why? Yeah, so yeah, yeah, it was more fun than I expected. I still have no idea what I'm doing. But it's fun and, and yeah, we walk around and we do things and we poke around I still don't know what I'm doing. But it was it was terrible, but not as terrible as I feared. So I wanted I figured out how to throw a ball and learn to conserve my balls and learn how to gather balls and gift balls. I could I could send people balls. Balls you can catch you catch you send somebody when you were at a stop the channel the loot from the stop

Unknown 1:07:52
you can send people gifts, but they don't necessarily contain balls.

Unknown 1:07:57
See I don't understand that when I went to the section it just showed me signs where I'd been now and it didn't show what it was what am i sending when I send that the

Unknown 1:08:04
gifts it can contain eggs Poke Balls start sending balls? Yes, yes, but but it's not you don't necessarily send the ball does that make sense?

Unknown 1:08:14
Whatever the contents of the sign right that's a stop it's a pokey stop that's different from a gym.

Unknown 1:08:19
And you're gonna have to pokey stops now at our office. See the difference?

Unknown 1:08:23
How do you get how do you become a pokey stop let alone two pokey stops good. Is there like a governing body? How do you do? Yes,

Unknown 1:08:31
yes. Good question. Merlin. Thank you Well, the the the Pokemon GO game is based on a another product that Niantic games, which is the company that Pokemon partnered with. I think it's called in Ingress Ingress. There we go. And basically it's the same concept of Pokemon GO but it's like you have to use your weapons to take down the like fortresses whereas Pokemon GO GO you need to use your adorable and slaved Pocket Monsters. Oh, so

Unknown 1:09:04
they're using that existing infrastructure about the spit all the like space and map and all that stuff gets repurposed. It's your throwing balls.

Unknown 1:09:13
Yes. But the reason you become a polka stop or previously a fortress is if you are a public work of art or a notable landmark and I think Starbucks all Starbucks or now or polka dots

Unknown 1:09:31
where there's a furniture store near our house that always has a lot of distraction distracted, distracted Asian youths in front of me.

Unknown 1:09:37
Well, and that's the great thing though is it doesn't matter if the mural or some sort of piece of art is there or not. It'll still usually be a polka stop. But since our office is now cooled murals and are slowly we're accumulating poker stops and it's very exciting. And then the also Yeah, now a gym a gym is different from poker, stop a gym, you not only can spin and give gifts, you also can battle the Pokemon that other trainers have left there. Does. Does that make sense?

Unknown 1:10:13
Yeah, I wasn't allowed to even enter the dojo until I'd reach level five. My kids a little reluctant to do gym bell. But she also said there's something about she's just spoken noises I didn't understand. But she said something about how you can leave something there and it makes money for you or something.

Unknown 1:10:30
Yes, you can leave one of your pocket monsters there. And it will battle other trainers for you. And then when it returns, it fades and returns and it brings polka coins with it that you can use to purchase poker balls. It's like a painting.

Unknown 1:10:48
I leave my goblins all over the city.

Unknown 1:10:57
Toby Toby.

Unknown 1:11:00
coin Toby.

Unknown 1:11:02
Oh, boy. Yeah, it's a it's a fun game. And I like it a lot. And it's kind of had a resurgence in the past few months because they brought back like, all the characters from the 90s like Team Rocket and what's what are not the one with the cute girl that's on the App Store.

Unknown 1:11:19
Huh? Yeah, that's what was as I was like, a lady in a shirt, right?

Unknown 1:11:24
Yeah, having a shirt that has an AR on it. Yeah, yeah.

Unknown 1:11:29
Yeah, I found myself sexually attracted to a girl in the App Store. Oh,

Unknown 1:11:31
yeah. That's it. Good for you.

Unknown 1:11:34
Yeah, yeah, I think it's pretty woke me. Oh, for sure. For sure. Let me be a furry and my furry now.

Unknown 1:11:39
You're part of Team Rocket? Yeah, you need to answer to

Unknown 1:11:43
I think I'm more team Team Rocket.

Unknown 1:11:44
I'm Got it. Got it.

Unknown 1:11:47
Alex, I have a question. So right now I'm going through my Pokemon list. And I'm turning some of the ones that I don't like into candy. Yes, and then feeding them to the other ones.

Unknown 1:11:57
So I like to think that you're just sending them to the professor and he's rewarding you with candy. So the professor

Unknown 1:12:06
has writing them

Unknown 1:12:07
in as many

Unknown 1:12:08
as many Pokemon as I have. The professor has that much candy for that Pokemon.

Unknown 1:12:14
me some of the candy.

Unknown 1:12:16
He could he could but you know, this is a no post apocalyptic post capitalist society where poker balls are the currency most of the time. They also have yen but really, it's it's the poker balls that you want. So he's sending you candy to thank you for helping him with his research.

Unknown 1:12:35
Oh, yeah. That's Oh, no, that's the guy from the boy band that always wants to talk to me.

Unknown 1:12:39
That's a different professor. He is the field professor.

Unknown 1:12:44
Okay, so there's a chair.

Unknown 1:12:50
The field Professor a Pokemon Go.

Unknown 1:12:51
He's also Really?

Unknown 1:12:54
Yeah, yeah, no, he's very spiky.

Unknown 1:12:57
Okay, did you learn how to you throw curveball?

Unknown 1:13:02
No, I but I do miss a lot. Okay.

Unknown 1:13:08
And then after you got them they run away. She's like, be careful.

Unknown 1:13:10
It's my it's my biggest objection with this game is that it's like fundamentally like the main thing you're doing which is fine. like throwing the balls at the Pokemon is very tedious and not fun.

Unknown 1:13:19
I love it. I love it. It's because I love my phone as it's $1,000 fidget toy. And now I get to fidget with my pocket monsters. I

Unknown 1:13:27
like Oh, boy.

Unknown 1:13:28
Whoa. No,

Unknown 1:13:30
yes. No, no, I know. I'm being supportive.

Unknown 1:13:33
Thank you. Thank you. Um,

Unknown 1:13:35
yeah, but it was fun. It was fun. And yeah, it was it was it was it was good. Now, can you tell the people about because I think this was in, I think this was in the after show. Could you tell the people about the wrist accessory that we bought.

Unknown 1:13:49
Um, alright, so the Pokemon Company released what was called the Pokemon GO plus. And it was this little thing. That kind of little looks like a polka stop, actually. And every time you got close to a Pokemon, or a polka stop, it would buzz, you would click the button on it, and you would get a gift or it would try to catch a pokemon for you. But the app did not need to be open. However, there were a number of third party companies that learned how to kind of hack the API that was I think it was like a hardware API. I honestly Oh, wow. Okay, cool. And the basically, it's like the way they the way they fake traffic and China. It's like it's it simulates cookies. So yeah, basically, they created this little bracelet that you don't need to tap it, it just automatically does everything for you. And you can also select whether you want to not let let's say you're playing this game for free, like a new but you can set it to not catch Pokemon you already have. Or to not collect things. That polka polka stops no more bulbous, or,

Unknown 1:14:59
yeah.

Unknown 1:15:03
But yeah, but this is something that now like half of our office owns. Mine is charging.

Unknown 1:15:09
Well, I'm happy to tell you that that was really the Nadir of my adult life was when I got a little risk thing that I had to set up and charge and learn how to use and look at the inscrutability up I still don't understand how it works. And I don't even know if I can't even count it's really the worst of all worlds because it doesn't know the charge doesn't last that long. To understand how it works, but no, but it's working for you you've got that's more like robot thanks to a fixed yourself.

Unknown 1:15:36
Yep, yep, yep, me it goes right next to my Apple

Unknown 1:15:38
Watch. Alex, does yours like state paired to the app? I like straight up doesn't work.

Unknown 1:15:44
No, you offer to repair it every I think it It depends on what build up the game. It depends on a lot of things. But usually you can if you've enabled notifications that will say your session and stopped and then you just repair it. That is with with the official products as well it happens. You got to repeat it

Unknown 1:16:08
I like to mention just in passing that john CRQC is right and I am the absolute worst at sending things to the wrong window. I just came very close to sending my family a picture of a sexy cosplay girl from a video game.

Unknown 1:16:22
Yes, that's rocket. Yeah.

Unknown 1:16:27
That will serve me well. Let's see.

Unknown 1:16:32
A rocket girl
