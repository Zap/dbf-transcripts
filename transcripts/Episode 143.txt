Merlin 3:18
Oh my god.

Unknown 3:18
This is the first time I've used this to record

Merlin 3:20
the recording. The recording of your terrible connection will be flawless now you'll have a good local recording. So the fact that you sound like you're talking through some wax paper on a comb won't be a problem.

Unknown 3:30
Microphone. Hang on now microphone. I'm going to make it so let's see. Does this make any difference? Is this better or worse better words flow into the cartridge.

Merlin 3:54

Unknown 4:44
oh my goodness. Is that a flip? Oh, no, it's not I got excited for a second.

Merlin 4:48
It's probably like yeah, it's back when we all had those little like cannons and my power shot.

Unknown 4:53
I love my flip cam so much

Merlin 4:55
the Flip Video Camera.

Unknown 4:57
Yep, yep.

Merlin 4:58
Oh, God, I had three I love that so so much. Fucking I had one I had one and then replace that one when it broke. And then I had the slightly upgraded one. And I feel like I said this a million times. But the we It was so great that that was concomitant. The popularity of that in my world was can comment with our kid being born. Because like we it was so easy to take these videos and like the existence of a sub perfect. Wow, this really gets into our topic. The existence of a sub perfect video is a bajillion times more important than the non existence of a flawless video. I'm saying just like you just having something you can literally like keeping your pocket that is a video camera is crazy. And it's less it's faster than an iPhone. I mean in some ways, you know, anyways, yeah, I love mine. Do you keep no did you keep the movies?

Unknown 5:48
Yes, I do. Or I mean No, nope, nope, definitely not. They're gone forever. No, they're actually I'm a video and if people want to happening I would not like I uploaded them all there on Vimeo.

Merlin 6:00
Yeah, I privatized online on Vimeo to I put a ton of stuff up there but now I have this big box full of hard drives and I'm finding ways to utilize oh hey buddy. Are you are you in?

Unknown 6:10
Am I Hello? Hello? Can you guys hear me now? Yes. Is it tolerable? Yes better this is great. Now I'm mobile now I can paste around the hotel room to I just have to carry around my my USB mix pre six.

Merlin 6:24
Oh, you should duct tape it to yourself like like a Jason Snell. You can duct tape and you can walk around or you can lay on the ground like a milk she can lay on literally like a milk

Unknown 6:32
a tactical tactical. What if I had a tactical belt and I clipped the USB pre mC mC six

Merlin 6:38
you would get more pussy than Sinatra? Mm hmm. You you walking around a Gen Bane Cohen with like a fanny pack.

Unknown 6:46
When you go to Gen Con, you got the fucking mix pre hanging off your belt. You've got the microphone, you have people come up and they go Excuse me. Are you a podcaster?

Merlin 6:54
Yeah, you gotta leather man. You gotta roll a tape.

Unknown 6:56
So we just Alex when we were leaving in the when we were leaving. So Merlin, we have a show. We're doing Oh, I saw. You saw please, please go on you go running. That was a good call if you ran away from that dude. Yep,

Unknown 7:08
I saw it. And I had already ordered. I literally just walked away in order to left. Please, please tell Merlin.

Unknown 7:14
That's why you were and that's why you were on time for the podcast. So you're fine. You're You're absolved. And so. So we're doing a show Gen Con, which I think I've mentioned on the podcast. And so the fans call Jennifer con. Almost. Well, that's for the true heads out there. You know, okay, let me let me put some on the staff person that I travel with a little rig in my backpack where when I go to conventions or events, I can make my own t shirts in my hotel room that reference little funny ideas or inside jokes that come up during the event your kid at which might think most normal people do

Unknown 7:48
a normal thing that Yep,

Merlin 7:50
you're just in time meme seamstress. I mean stress.

Unknown 7:53
Yeah, so I have a little t shirt rig in my suitcase that I travel with. And last year, I had a funny idea for a T shirt. And I thought that I should make a T shirt that said general convention 2018 which I thought was a very funny joke. And I wore it to Gen Con and about 200 I could not go down the hallway without someone stopping me and going Excuse me, but it's short for Geneva Convention.

Merlin 8:21
That's that's really all you

Unknown 8:23
know, I know that this isn't official merchandise because it's it's incorrect. It's Geneva Convention.

Merlin 8:28
I'm sorry. I've been I've been milling around for the next last 6.35 minutes and I just have to say something. I tried to stop myself.

Unknown 8:36
Would you have had to make the joke more obnoxious and more like Genocide Convention? Like how does someone not

Merlin 8:43
your show?

Unknown 8:59
Please tell the story of Mr. Mason.

Unknown 9:02
Okay, so we are doing a show at Gen Con Friday and Saturday nights probably almost certainly sold out by the time you hear this. But it's that, you know, we've done these shows the Gen Con for a long time was doing with these big crazy theaters. And they're like, Live Nation venues. And they just they sucks. They just Suck my balls so much. They take all the money Live Nation, like we were always like to take a huge bath on these shows because all the money goes to Live Nation for their goddamn fees. And there's these huge union crews, like don't know how to run the theater and that they miss our sound and lighting cues. Like it's it really grates on me. And so we haven't done them for the last few years. And this year, the guy the partners were like, Oh, we should do a job one of those Gen Con shows again. And I was like, the only way we could do it is if we find like a new venue. And I was like it's got to be somewhere weird. Like there must be like some sort of like masonic lodge in Indianapolis that we can rent. And sure enough there is and this place is a IK it's called the Scottish Rite Cathedral. And you just have to Google and look at pictures. I can't even describe Alex, can you even put it into words what it's like

Unknown 10:02
a it's like if you saw the outside of a Catholic Church, but then went inside and you're like, Oh, this is definitely either place where people have weddings or secret meetings are held surprised.

Merlin 10:14
It looks up. Yeah, it looks like the this the Stonecutters on?

Unknown 10:17
Yes, exactly. And yeah, I don't know much about the Masons, other than I shouldn't know much about them. Yeah, they don't back women, right. Yes. So that's that's about right.

Merlin 10:30
Now this was it from the outside. It's very Cathedral. Like it's where

Unknown 10:33
we try not to hire any. I know. I wish in case we ever need to go into a Masonic Lodge.

Unknown 10:41
Alright, so I see. So as we're leaving with Tom is showing me like this thing just keeps going and going going and move a huge a huge like Cathedral that we're doing our show and and there's a huge ballroom that we're doing this party and

Merlin 10:54
well, this is the thing with the with the you've got the Gothic ceiling, and like chandelier, that's the room.

Unknown 11:00
Yeah, that's where our show is gorgeous. And there's another room, a completely different room. That's also gorgeous. That's like a formal ballroom for like 400 people. And we're doing a party in there like the next night like, it's all crazy. And as we're leaving, there's a fucking a whole other floor with like a cafe. And a and like another ballroom that's also gorgeous a guy as is blowing my mind. And we're walking away and I go and I said to Tom, I go, this must be the nicest masonic lodge in the United States of America. Like I can't imagine that. There's another one that's nicer. And as I said that there happened to be um, dude in a Mason's polo shirt, rolling a hard case of what I assume our board games down and he goes, excuse me, but do you mind if I tell you about Mason's and I was like, Oh, boy.

Unknown 11:50
I got a little scared to say no.

Unknown 11:52
Oh, and that is when I turned around.

Unknown 11:54
And then he goes, and then he goes, are you max Temkin from Cards Against Humanity and secret Hitler. And I was like, this is about to go real good or real bad. Like, yeah,

Merlin 12:03
you're either about to get a really good secret tour, or he's gonna wear your skin.

Unknown 12:08
Yes. And, you know, it turns out it was neither he gave it we got a short talk about, about the history of the temple, and it is a really cool Masonic Temple. And and then he said, and then he was telling us about the membership. I don't remember why he I, the whole thing was not strung together in a sort of causal or narrative structure. All the information he was given, I would have probably, and he was telling me, there's 33 levels of masons. He says, the 33rd level is reserved. It's just honorary. It's just honor. You have to be invited. And I thought, well, here's a dude who's clearly really into Mason's stuff. And I've booked out his whole house for for our show. And he's telling me that there's an honorary membership. And I thought he knew me, he recognized me by sight as a famous board game designer. And I thought, he probably wants me to become an honorary member. And I said, and I said, I said, What's the deal with that? I said, Give me an honorary membership. We rented out the whole thing and he goes, Oh, he says, I could never possibly do that. He goes, he goes, maybe in another life I couldn't possibly do it.

Merlin 13:10
It there's no way Whoa, he just left it at that.

Unknown 13:12
He left it at that. Yeah, he's like, he's like, maybe in another life if I if I was a philanthropist or something. I don't know. If you buy someone's on. Remember, I have no idea how it works. I don't actually want to be amazing that bad, but I just thought it was funny that that,

Merlin 13:25
but it's nice to be as nice to be asked.

Unknown 13:27
Nice. Yes. I would love to be asked and then be like, I don't need it. But I want to be asked

Merlin 13:32
my grandfather. My grandfather was a Mason. And he was in Scottish Rite. And yeah,

Unknown 13:41
good one. I don't really know.

Merlin 13:43
Yeah, I think that's that's a good one. Um, I think the folks from your tribe will never in a million years be allowed in but

Unknown 13:48
that's why he was like that's why he said maybe in another life

Merlin 13:52
Yeah.

Unknown 13:56
Wow, that's right. We still control the media.

Merlin 13:59
We do it

Unknown 14:02
That's funny. I'm gonna make that joke when we when we when I open up the show. I'm going to go this is the most Jews that have ever been in this building in the history of

Unknown 14:11
the 1920s

Unknown 14:13
don't nobody tell them

Unknown 14:16
I should make it you know, I should make a custom t shirt that says not Jewish.

Merlin 14:22
No, no, no, you should do get a traditional like I don't wanna be on on tasteful but like, you know, let's just say like two yellow triangles composing a star and you put a poster to that. And that's your way of letting people know note you know, Jerry

Unknown 14:36
that was actually quite dense. Very funny. I should

Merlin 14:39
thank you. That was quite humorous Merlin just in

Unknown 14:41
case I need this I'm going to make a T shirt that says not not Jewish

Merlin 14:49
it's got a little pig

Unknown 14:54
we're never going to be able to

Unknown 14:56
do and then on the on the back it says does do not control the media. Yeah

Merlin 15:02
I'm not your banker James Baldwin movie

Unknown 15:06
I not only do I not put the Gentile baby boy on the motto I don't even like mindset. So you're

Unknown 15:26
a Gen Con. General the general I'm at the general convention at the general

Merlin 15:30
convention it's got to be a very hectic time for you guys.

Unknown 15:33
Oh yeah. I mean yeah, would you like me to elaborate it's I mean there's people always ask what's going

Merlin 15:39
well so mostly I was just gonna ask Did you Did you get me and my daughter and he treats yet

Unknown 15:43
Oh no, we are on day negative one of

Unknown 15:47
the convention hasn't started yet. But I'm here's what I'm going to do is when I go out when I do go on the show floor, I'm probably going to be Is there a time when I could face time both of you and show you the little little selection of little models? And then you could sort of pick

Merlin 15:59
Oh, I mean, pop sure just give us a heads up I mean, we're I'm I'm bachelor dad. Thursday must Friday Yeah.

Unknown 16:37
And you can pick out some like Matson like monsters

Merlin 16:40
I would love that with the other thing is Dungeons and Dragons. Get some Dungeons and Dragons. If you if you see it. I believe they just announced there's going to be a tabletop game of the balance arc from Taz. Yeah,

Unknown 16:53
our friends are working on it.

Merlin 16:55
Oh, okay. What a weird name drop I just did. Yeah. Why your friend?

Unknown 17:01
Our buddy Keith Baker's making that game so will will. He lives in Canada. Yeah. What to do? He's not

Merlin 17:10
at the party. All my friends are here. You can see. That's really cool. Yeah.

Unknown 17:15
Listen, I've always thought it would be very fun to play a role playing game on do right Friday as a challenge. And maybe that's the one I

Merlin 17:21
love. I love love. Love that. And I'm so excited. See now when I pitched her the games you recommended antics describing the mechanics she's like, she's wanting to like play Minecraft and watch TV, but then I played her the segment where you described it. And her ears really perked up.

Unknown 17:37
Huh.

Merlin 17:39
He described you know the way you just you described a few games. I haven't explored them yet. But like the one where you can do hit say stop, and then like have a flashback like wouldn't it? What an amazing idea for a mechanic? Isn't that cool? Yeah, it's really cool. But so far, so good. So it's at this point I've only ever worked at. So I've been to stuff like Macworld, but I've only ever worked at two trade shows. One Are you were you were you doing magic tricks for people or were you doing everything I do is a magic trick by definition. I did I know I did a I did I did one for doesn't really matter. But it was it was a database trade show was the first time I had to come to San Francisco in 97 and I

Unknown 18:18
database trades show DV Expo.

Merlin 18:21
Welcome to TV Expo. I did I done the website for DB Expo and now I had to do things with photos

Unknown 18:28
Dubai XDBX poser shower, you're going to get a guy you're going to get a lot of guys with the USB mix presets hanging off their belt.

Merlin 18:38
TV Expo 1997 oh my god you described it a scrape the ladies.

Unknown 18:44
You don't if you don't if you don't have a T shirt? t shirt for that to you I would wear that T shirt every day.

Unknown 18:49
Oh my god,

Merlin 18:50
you know what you would like you would like another trade show. So I did mostly do PC Expo which is a huge deal. PC Expo DB Expo my hair the one you enjoy was one called Aqua Tana. website. It was a that's for

Unknown 19:03
men. That's for men and the horses. They love

Merlin 19:05
horses. It's like you know, it's a lot like a lot like Hedwig. It's like one man, one horse. It's each of us have a set a makeup. Funny, you should do that. You should do that. Because really, it's about the two pieces coming together coming together

Unknown 19:29
coming together.

Merlin 19:30
They're coming together. The other one was for the real estate. com I was gonna mention this. I know we've talked about this before. But the impression that I walked away with from all my experiences as a visitor to things like this. And as somebody participant is what a goddamn floor to ceiling racket. The entire affair is you mentioned some of this but like we were there and there was stuff like union guys, you're not allowed to give you costs extra for a trash can. And then it costs extra to have the trash can emptied. You're not allowed to empty the trash can. You're not allowed to unplug a USB, there's all this stuff. And then there's also like you they're like a Yeah, you know, you probably want to hire a security guard for your booth. Because he's, you know, like a Simpsons character. You probably want to hire a security guy for your booth. Really? Sure. Okay. All right, but now sign this way. But if anything gets stolen, it's not our fault. It's like Yeah, you got to be kidding me for like $100,000 booth you like did so do you encounter that as as the as the person who participates? Is it those the racket that it seems like

Unknown 20:33
all your left and right.

Merlin 20:36
For everything you pay for the pipe, you pay for the drape this this kind of carpet things extra, like Isn't it like just a ridiculous racket?

Unknown 20:42
I mean, God forbid you need like a, like a power outlet or internet. I mean,

Unknown 20:46
that's literally $2,000. But it's worse to because if you don't want you know, the stock drape and table like you have to pay double to bring in your own because reasons I guess. And it's but

Merlin 20:59
of course, yeah,

Unknown 21:00
but that's it. No, no. And then it's a separate strange fee as well. So it doesn't I don't I don't know.

Merlin 21:06
And imagine trying to do that with horses. How complicated that would be. I don't think horses actually came to the show. They came they came with their companion.

Unknown 21:17
They came, okay.

Merlin 21:19
Yeah, they came together. That's how you pick a sensor. I'm putting my horse back on the shelf.

Unknown 21:28
The the problem I have with these trade shows is that like, just by doing them, they make you very normal. Like they're almost designed for you to be like an interchangeable puzzle piece.

Merlin 21:40
Oh, it's like getting involved with like the wedding industry or the funeral industry. Like Don't try to do anything different or you'll be ground up in the gear

Unknown 21:48
we were to, like, let me just put it this way. I mean, I don't I can't talk about data, but something as cool as database Expo but a show for with booths for game companies. The prescribed but correct thing for us to do is we should pay for a booth. And we have pipe and drape and we decorate it and we give away freebies and we sell Cards Against Humanity for cash at the booth and we'll sign stuff for you and their shifts. And we've done that, like we've done that that was the first year we ever came to Gen Con. That's what we did. And the feeling I had was when we did that we stopped being Cards Against Humanity. And we that we were just in that moment. We were just like a game purveyor generic, just cranking out some shit. And here's our box. And there's their box, and it's all the same. And you walk over here and you're like,

Unknown 22:29
it's the generic convention.

Unknown 22:30
Generic convention. Exactly. It was like very, like, I felt like we weren't Cards Against Humanity. We were like, nice brand.

Merlin 22:39
You know? Yes. No, like, exactly. You're not exactly generic, but you're like, like generic with a yellow logo. Yeah, that's what that's it. That's why I say the wedding industry, the funeral industry, like weddings are really bad. Or you know, any of those things were like there's such a mature industry of gouging people. Like if you want to get creative get as creative is you want as long as it's something we've got on the menu, or you're just going to be a real outlier.

Unknown 23:04
Well, that's what it's like, every time we come to these conventions. We're like, Can we make our table blue? And there has to be like, like, we have to have an all about this and that. Yeah. They want to make the table blue. Jerry. It's crazy. Like, every everyone around every system is designed to say like no to doing anything that would make you stand out or be creative. And it's really death to me, and I really don't like doing these conventions. So that's why we rent like a that's why we're renting a Masonic Lodge and doing a comedy show because at least it's not technically part of Gen Con, but at least it's our own thing. At least it's you know, at least it'll be us right?

Merlin 23:37
Yeah, yeah. The show's fine. It looks like your tickets. I saw the Twitter let's say your tickets are you know, come along real well.

Unknown 23:43
Yeah, I think we're going to sell out I'm feeling good about it. I was very nervous. I thought maybe no one would come there's over the stage there's a sword hanging over the stage and it's the sword of Damocles and if you're not if you're not funny if you do upon and it doesn't land Wow, that's great sword fucking falls on you. Actually. It falls into our ADA accessible seating area.

Unknown 24:09
With the sword there the Masons did

Merlin 24:12
Mason sword on my sword

Unknown 24:13
they don't they don't like the Jews or the disabled.

Merlin 24:17
Every time I Shriner students to help a crippled child,

Unknown 24:19
our Shriners different than Mason's

Merlin 24:22
it's, it's there. They're real. It's related. It's related. But yeah, Mike, my grandfather was deep and all this stuff he was I don't know if he's in the 30s. But so you might want to pick yourself up a copy of Duncan's ritual of Freemasonry. That's, that's where they first revealed some of the arcane Secrets of the stone cutters. Stuff like they make you stand on a platform blindfold and then they push you off and you only fall a couple inches, but you know, and then I think they spent can give you a hand.

Unknown 24:54
Oh, gotcha. There

Merlin 24:55
you go. Yeah. What's the smell? What's the smell? Like? I've been thinking a lot about smells. Actually. I was just listening to them. I've been banned where they had come back from bleeding at PAX East. And we're talking about the owners of a crowd house. What's the smell situation like? So? I'm not making a nerd joke, unless that's what you choose to infer. But is there a smell situation going on?

Unknown 25:18
You're just asking questions. Marlin. I'm just asking the question. So here's the deal. So in some in some gaming conventions, part of the design of the convention is that they have like a like a gaming area and there's people there all your does, it sort of meant for you to hang out there, like all weekend and just game. Gen Con is that PAX East is that other conventions aren't so much that and I will say bye day to PAX East really smells quite bad. And it smells like sour milk. And body odor like definitely men definitely boys locker room. Mm hmm. It's got that wet, very wet. Bo smell.

Merlin 26:00
Yeah, I mean, it's I noticed this the other day, when I took a Lyft and I mentioned this on Twitter, but my Lyft driver, really super smelled like a Philadelphia, Huggy. And then I arrived at to pick my daughter up at camp and somebody at the camp smelled like the same hoagie. And so I looked at myself, and I said, Hey, I wonder if that's me. So I went around the corner. So my daughter wouldn't be embarrassed, no one and I held up my left arm, and I stuck my face real deep in there. And I and I was like, pretty assured that it's not me. But at a certain point, it's hard to tell and you get into a Seinfeld situation where you're not sure if it's you, that stinks now, but there is a mass group, sandwich type smell. That just seems to happen when a lot of dudes get together.

Unknown 26:42
I know that it did not go over so well when we made comments about the Jonathan Coulton cruise when we talked about that I'm just gonna say this that at the top of the cruise pollen storm now say you have to shower during your time on the cruise and then going into swimming pool does not replace

Merlin 26:58
what is the shower doesn't accommodate you.

Unknown 27:25
Berlin Have you ever been to Indianapolis? Yes. I mean, I was

Merlin 27:31
there the day of a bomb scare. Oh, capital. Oh, I came to do I came to do a talk there. Oh, and I bought a I bought a breaking away off brand cutters t shirt. And yeah, I thought was a really neat little town. Yeah, I've been I didn't spend a ton of time but yeah.

Unknown 27:47
Oh,

Unknown 27:48
I kind of like Indianapolis. What

Merlin 27:50
is wrong with you people? Oh my god. What did you like it? Well, it is Indiana.

Unknown 27:54
It is Indiana. The city. It's a small city and yet it smells like three times worse than Chicago. There's very interesting. Oh, yeah, I how there's no place to like, hang out or eat food. There's lovely art everywhere. But then there's litter all around it. And there's just like, when Gen Con happens. There's the Indianapolis smell and then the Gen Con nerd smell just it forms together. And it's unique to anywhere else in the world. I think like not even New York Comic Con has this weird. I don't know. It's like a fog. And then you go from hotel and it just doesn't ever leave. Like at least at PAX. It's contained to one place.

Unknown 28:42
Last year, I was walking back from some party or another. And the streets of Indianapolis smelled so bad. I mean, it's one of the worst smells I've ever smelled in my entire life. So I would say that it was it was a little bit like the aftertaste of the Lord. But it was like aerosolized and put into the air. I mean, it tasted I mean it was it was it was thick. It's not I mean, I would say like the first note was like burning rubber. That was very forward. But it had like a like an awful like organic component. I mean, it was a really bad

Merlin 29:12
it was not nice. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to say that I did this but I just went to the Google website and entered into words. Indianapolis smell and there's a lot of people talking about the smell. Why does Indianapolis stink asks TripAdvisor? Where is this smell coming from as the Indianapolis Reddit This is what we know about the gas smelling Annapolis this morning.

Unknown 29:36
It was gas It was very good It had it had a sulphurous gassy smell but I'm real I'm telling you. The first thing was burning rubber these are all different for different years. Do you ever have a little electrical fire like like like like like like we had in our office a couple of weeks ago there was like a little bit of In the Kitchen there's a little bit of a burning smell and I realized someone had left our beverage cooler open all weekend and so the record it was running it did not smell that is not a good smell. You do not want to smell that

Merlin 30:04
no not at all. Not at all. But I mean it sounds like it's something is not lost on people. I think it's you know when you're around a smell for a while you start noticing it as much until you go away and come back.

Unknown 30:11
So I tweeted I said I am smelling the word like I'm sure that I have cancer now from smelling I'm 100% sure that I have bone cancer now just from taking one with of this.

Unknown 30:22
I can feel my I can feel my my my bones turning into like pocket sticks.

Unknown 30:30
Every breath I take and I tweeted it and I was like What in God's name is the smell. And everyone was like oh yeah, it's just like that.

Merlin 30:38
Yeah, well, okay. Yeah,

Unknown 30:42
thanks. Cool.

Unknown 30:47
Yeah, all right. Now Now I have now I have I have bruises all over my body and I might have grown gills

Unknown 30:54
there's no calcium in my bones anymore. It's all gone.

Merlin 30:57
You can tell just just from the smell and you put you can feel you're so in touch with your bones. That you know when the cancer as has gotten there because of the smell.

Unknown 31:05
Yeah, I can feel it coming in.

Merlin 31:08
Yeah, it's weird college towns can be like that. Gainesville is kind of like that in Florida. There are these towns that are like this weird hybrid of Oh, how does one say like you know, not not Metropolitan, but a college town combined with somewhere rural or combined with somewhere financial, and that can sometimes be a very strange combination. I mean, it's it's it's real weird like when you get like it doesn't take long concentric circles around the University of Florida and like it gets really super weird like people throwing stuff from pickup trucks pretty fast. But the smell I don't I don't know about the smell. I bought a futon there once.

Unknown 31:44
I think it's like a pharmaceutical company makes that smell.

Merlin 31:48
Oh you think so? Like in New Jersey like one of those they make your ice cream taste but they also make the Indianapolis smell.

Unknown 31:54
There's some sort of pharmaceutical company in downtown Indianapolis and I think that's what I was smelling.

Merlin 32:00
Yeah, they got fireworks and racism do they do yeah just crossed in Cincinnati boy you just stopping the Pontiac and good Indiana. Stock up on all the fireworks and racism.

Unknown 32:15
there's a there's a gigantic sign we pass every year and it's a lovely tradition that just says Hell is real. And I'm sure like people have seen this in mediums and and folks are like that's not real. No, no, it's real. Someone just owns a plot of land and put up the sign and has paid for this piece of land.

Merlin 32:33
Oh, there it is like a black sign with white letters. Yep,

Unknown 32:35
yep. That's Uh huh. Yeah. I took a selfie with it one time. Oh, nice. I thought it was very cool. I don't know why.

Merlin 32:45
St. Peter's gonna love that.

Unknown 32:46
Huh? What? Merlin What do you think Max is eating? I'm wondering it took tax. Oh, are they orange? Hmm.

Unknown 32:55
I had to stop and I had to stop and charge my car outside of a warm on the way here and I I went into the Walmart and there was a huge yellow thing that looked like a minion and it says Tic Tac fruit adventure. And I was like, and I was like, I have to know I have to know.

Merlin 33:15
charging the car. Um, what he's saying Alex

Unknown 33:18
Tic Tac fruit adventure. He's going on his first adventure.

Merlin 33:22
I thought I thought at first I thought at first you were shuffling cards and then I assumed you were eating cards as part of an effect and we would know by the end No, it's a

Unknown 33:33
tic tac fruit adventure over 200 minutes.

Merlin 33:35
Are we supposed to well thinking of it? Are we supposed to credit Marco for nuts?

Unknown 33:40
I thought we said Marco I'll say this

Unknown 33:43
Marco got very wounded that that we didn't say that he invented nuts com back in 2004 or whatever. But Braga found this website independently because she was searching for not flowers and they had them and they delivered them quickly.

Unknown 33:56
And fucking to you the Veronica's never listened to five minutes.

Unknown 34:00
I have never been more certain of anything in my life than that Veronica did not hear about this from our whenever I was I'm not allowed to listen to the Marco's podcasts in the car and Veronica finds them intolerable and rightfully so because what did they talk about different? Yeah, cages have USB cables butterfly keys. Yeah,

Merlin 34:16
I've been using it since it was legumes.edu slash children have been using it since it was just it just Mr. Peanut with a private Unix account.

Unknown 34:27
Okay, well, that was that was after they got bought by cashews.org.

Merlin 34:33
CGI men will form anyway, apologies to Marco sorry, we didn't credit you for nuts.

Unknown 34:41
I discovered that

Unknown 34:46
they should give Marco a banner on this. They should say thank you Marco. Marco is nuts.

Unknown 34:53
They sent him a T shirt. Wow. They did yeah, there's a blog post. He has an entire blog post about nuts calm and you

Merlin 35:00
have a post about the about the hand feel of the shirt.

Unknown 35:02
Uh huh. No, wait, I gotta find it. I gotta find it. It's good. Did you play

Merlin 35:08
the Did you did you buy the Sony something? Something something thousand three. Didn't anybody else buy those because everyone else is buying them?

Unknown 35:14
No, no, those are really expensive. They're like, Oh, millionaires phones. I mean, no,

Merlin 35:21
they're good but they're terrible. The good the terrible Why do terrible they sound amazing, but they are dog shit for trying to pair with multiple devices. It's crazy making gonna like show it seems like you gotta like, shut it all the way off and turned all the way back on to turn it on. Alex, you have to hold the button for six seconds. Oh, no nuts. cut this out. That's boring. That

Unknown 35:46
really though? How does how does the top feel? I don't know. I it doesn't look comfortable to me. They look the

Merlin 35:53
headband part. Yeah, I thought was pretty comfortable. I mean, they're portable. The sound the thing is the I know some people I think Michael particular say he doesn't like noise cancellation, but it seems like you

Unknown 36:06
It's not that I don't like it. It makes me dizzy and feel weird. I don't know. It's it's.

Merlin 36:12
I don't know. I have to agree with Mike though. The most CGP gray thing that's ever CGP grade is CGP gray with these costly Sony headphones on a plane listening to play noise on them. I mean, it's the most PGP great thing ever because he just doesn't want to hear. He plays playing noise over noise cancelling headphones when he's on a plane.

Unknown 36:34
That makes sense. If you I agree with you, Merlin makes sense. To me. It makes sense. It makes absolute sense. Especially because you don't want to think about what's happening on the plane if you are on like by a bus in Chicago always makes the same noise. If that bus is making a different noise, then your head just will crumble into anxiety. But if the plane is always making the same noise, it's great. So why not? Just Why not? You know look at dryer like a dryer sound. Um, I have become a fan of what what's the like? What whatever the noise is my dishwasher makes sure I only knew that because we had to get it replaced and it doesn't make that noise. It makes me very sad. And I

Merlin 37:21
told your landlord before you did

Unknown 37:23
it. No, he did it to us before he did it to a new to the new dishwasher. Which is great because we told him two years ago that the other one seemed to be breaking so we have a new dishwasher. But um, socks

Unknown 37:40
you really need to move

Unknown 37:41
the dishwasher. All right, let me let me paint a word picture the dishwasher is next to the sink as in as most places Yes. And underneath the sink is a cabinet. But now the cabinet cannot be fully closed because the dishwasher juts out too much. And that would drive me crazy. I really felt one with you and Siracusa in that moment. I

Merlin 38:05
never stopped noticing that

Unknown 38:07
well and but the end normally be fine but that that used to be the chemical place right like we were we have the detergent or whatever this stuff is and the I don't wear the stuff you drink to not get autism that stuff and so now Sure, sure, sure.

Merlin 38:22
And I solution. Yeah, yeah,

Unknown 38:23
yeah. And I just don't want the cats getting I don't have a problem with my cats being autistic. So I really don't want them drinking the bleach that lives there. So yeah, it's it's a new and and then he's like, Oh,

Merlin 38:36
it's gonna fall on. What would you know you're being supportive? Oh my god.

Unknown 38:51
I've made an incredible discovery.

Merlin 38:53

Merlin 41:33
is like fascinated by the things that turn up on Spotify. I sent you a link you don't need to go look at this. But so you know there's all the different noises you got white noise you got pink noise. I'm a fan of brown noise.

Unknown 41:46
That's a real thing.

Unknown 41:47
Am I gonna play this and it's just a part time.

Unknown 41:49
Am I just going to shit if I hear this?

Merlin 41:52
Oh, you talk about the brown sound? Yeah, no, that's different. That's innocent munition they use it on targeted individuals. Now this is an entire sub brown noise it's pretty treating go read it but basically there's just a fall off and what the frequencies are these different things like white noise is the classic but white noise is like pink pink pink noise is more like brown noise is like brown noise is great for covering up covering up like male voices which are the voices I must want covered up. But what's cool is this is a 15 track. Oh, that's my shit. That is a 15 track album called brown noise therapy with 15 different tracks on it. Oh, what about what about number one number?

Merlin 44:01
There is a 90 minute brown noise that I prefer. Now you don't get the granularity and cleanliness of these. But

Unknown 44:10

Merlin 44:15
Yeah.

Unknown 44:16

Unknown 44:27
Yeah, yeah.

Merlin 44:29
It's idling huh?

Unknown 44:30
I mean, this is a brown noise if there ever was one. Yeah. What if we just put that under the whole show? Do you think people would have noticed by now?

Unknown 44:40
I will have gotten at least a dozen tweets by by now. Yeah, yeah.

Merlin 44:44
Yeah. Because it sounds so crazy. Yeah, so you sound drunk. Want to play it at one XO noise is sped up and now it's not clean anymore? canceling my account? Yeah, yeah, look at noise. But yeah, Spotify is a hell of a thing. They've got a bunch of like books on tape and stuff. They've got all these like Kurt Vonnegut reading his books. There's so much crazy stuff on Spotify. I guess I should close this political page.

Unknown 45:10
We've definitely talked about the fake Spotify artists. And I have no problem because they're pretty high enjoy some of that peaceful piano.

Merlin 45:19
This was on Reply All they talked about the this phenomenon and that one artists they found us in that episode.

Unknown 45:27
I think so.

Merlin 45:28
This is the latest episode.

Unknown 45:31
Oh, this one? The the one with marijuana and they'd found Yes, yes.

Merlin 45:38
Yes. Yes. Summer hotline episode. Yeah.

Unknown 45:42
There's there are other people though, that apparently Spotify. Spotify has just like, Oh, we created or

Merlin 45:50
people put on like, like minutes of like, just like silence and encourage their fans to just play it. Yeah, that's wild.

Unknown 45:58
Yeah, that's bullshit. Just make a song. Yeah,

Unknown 46:01
yeah.

Merlin 46:03
Why not? Pick a song, man.

Unknown 46:07
I did it. There we go. That's the second best brown noise ever.

Merlin 46:10
We should do that. You know that could be that could be a bonus for our listeners is will make brown noise for you. loop it. Oh. I saw your Korean water go suck. Not sure that's good for sleeping.

Unknown 46:39
Berlin It was your challenge.

Merlin 46:41
Yeah, this is a philosophical challenge. As it turns out, over the last three years, my family my daughter and I in particular, I've had lots of fun doing face swapping with the app called masquerade. There are other apps that do that snapchats Howard mystery there. But I thought it'd be fun to do some Facebook whopping and to just have to take tax max.

Unknown 47:06
Fruit adventure.

Merlin 47:09
Everybody has phases in college. So yeah, yeah. That'd be fun, though. So the challenges do some do some face swaps. And. And that was the challenge. Did anybody have an awkward? Alex, you sent me a very upsetting face swap.

Unknown 47:26
I mean, that was my my winner. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't know it. I guess we're talking about this now. Yeah, I face swapping has been around for a while. I don't know why we did it as a challenge. It just started making me very upset and paranoid about everything. Because it's gotten a little too good. They're just somewhere like that worked out a little too. Well. That's not like it got it. Like there are some that are just a little too deep faking? Like if Yeah,

Merlin 48:00
it's I actually have a fair amount say about this Max. Max, did you have a chance to do any face swapping at all?

Unknown 48:05
I have to say I couldn't really get it to work very well.

Merlin 48:08
That's what I was gonna say. It's weird what it will and won't swap. It's really it's really, it's along the lines of I mean, my Nest Cam, which does face recognition face identification, it thinks that a bucket with three balls in it at the foot of our steps is a face. And it wasn't only it's only fairly recently that they added the option to say that's not a face, but like it is it's really weird because you know, obviously humans are very highly attuned to recognizing what is called Peridot Leah like our ability to like see faces and almost everything. But it's interesting like I get that guess there's some element of depth mapping to it. I don't know like I kept trying to do a swap you well. Essential link I don't know if that link will work. Can you get to my pictures?

Unknown 48:50
Try and try and here we go.

Merlin 48:53
It's weird what it will and won't do. So these are just over the years and some recent ones. I cannot top the one of me and the doll. That's obviously the bus. Oh, that's so good, man. The way that you Good job, buddy. Wow,

Unknown 49:08
do you just oh, let's see if I can.

Unknown 49:10
That's our commander. That's our commander in chief.

Merlin 49:13
That's right. Whoa, is that in the skirt?

Unknown 49:16
Yeah, that's massacred. Mustard.

Merlin 49:19
Damn Mac swapped with with with the President. Look at that.

Unknown 49:23
I'm a responder now.

Merlin 49:26
It was down there. 911. You know, the stage falls? You won't fall very far. Sorry. Okay, so can you see mine? See, I thought it'd be fun to throw in some good ones, but also doing some deliberately terrible ones just to talk about the media. And here's the thing. We don't have to talk about face swaps at a time. But I this morning, I found myself really thinking a lot about what was I kept coming down to this idea of like, do you want to be Barbra Streisand? Or do you want to be Amy Sedaris? Like when you get into the world of filters, I know there's common ground, but there are like there's the kind of filter that really oversimplifies and prettied

Unknown 50:04
up your face and know what it means to be Amy Sedaris.

Merlin 50:09
I sent a funny link, Amy Sedaris is. I mean, let me get it out of the way. She's a very funny comedian. But she's also she's a pretty lady, and she loves fucking herself up like she loves making herself really grotesque. And a great example that is Jerry blank, which is a character that was created with the rest of the team of strangers with candy. But like, she really likes the idea of making herself like a grotesquerie, right, it's really fun. And maybe that's a privilege thing, because she is actually a beautiful woman. But like, it's interesting, kind of, like with all these things, they're the things that like, sort of simplify your features, and make you you know, conventionally pretty or interesting or anime. And then there's the ones that really fuck you up and make you a Warcraft guy. Or, like, you know, there's weird videos that like really distort your face. And it just got me thinking about I sound like, such considered lady, but he's gonna be thinking about, like, over the years, how our idea of presentation has changed, you know, from the age of the selfie onward, where like, how we choose to present ourselves, what things we have in the background of a photo and stuff like that has changed over time. which brought me to, I finally said, you know, why don't I just get the pure uncut shit, I will download Snapchat, I had an account years ago that I never used. The app is no less baffling to me in 2019 than it was whenever that was, but yeah, no, I don't know. We'll talk about anything you want. I just that's by design. It's for teens. And you're supposed it's supposed to

Unknown 51:35
be something that signals that it's for kids is that there's arcane knowledge, huh? Yeah. It's it's supposed to be like the same thing as Minecraft. Like, if you ever played Minecraft,

Merlin 51:45
just a tiny bit? Yeah.

Unknown 51:47
If you go into Minecraft, there's no tutorial. There's no help. There's no you don't you just have to learn from other kids what to do. Right? Right. Like you don't even know how to make all the fucking recipes and tools.

Merlin 51:57
You don't know to go make a table that makes the thing right.

Unknown 52:00
Oh, I don't like that.

Merlin 52:01
So anyways, some of the ones with my kid are pretty funny. There's one of me and Steven Hackett. That was pretty good because we're both wearing glasses. And it's really fucked up like,

Unknown 52:10
Oh, no, what you were hanging out with Steven Hackett. So these

Merlin 52:13
are some of mine just over the years that I thought were fun. There's me swapping with joy, a doll of joy from where we're at Click, Click the drop box link and hopefully you can login. Oh, I see.

Unknown 52:25
I see. Okay. I think Dropbox is Dropbox is evil, right?

Unknown 52:29
Yeah, I don't know.

Unknown 52:30
Boy, I fucking I had a bad week. Last week. I can use zoom and the asshole email app.

Unknown 52:35
Yeah,

Unknown 52:37
I canceled my subscription. The evil I didn't I didn't know that the email. I've had that functionality and I canceled my subscription. I don't use it anymore.

Merlin 52:44
Really? I'm really surprised to hear that wider. They were they suck and Well, I mean, they I mean like it's in what sucks is the ongoing. Like, oh, boo boo. You caught us Facebook kind of thing. That's not very fun. But I thought you really like treasure the functionality of that app?

Unknown 52:59
No, not that much.

Merlin 53:00
Oh, okay. Well, it seemed like it. Is that you and Cara? Yes. Yes, it is. That's actually considering that's actually pretty good.

Unknown 53:09
Oh, no, that's upset.

Merlin 53:11
Because you got that you got that kind of skinhead thing where you get that little little shock of hair. Oh, no.

Unknown 53:16
Yeah, I got the like universe situation. Like, I don't even know how to OO

Merlin 53:20
Max. Max. Can you see mine on the dropbox?

Unknown 53:23
Hey, Merlin. Yes. And seeing that picture of Alex and Cara. Yes. If you were to lean way over that balcony, and haka, looky all the way across the street. So to the described a beautiful park across the street. Yeah, you could have spent on Eric Trump from exactly that spot. Yeah, no kidding. Was he in town? No, that's but that's where he got spit on.

Merlin 53:46
Oh, my goodness. Oh, wow. This is important.

Unknown 53:50
Across the street across the street.

Merlin 53:51
The worst thing about this world with you and Kara is that you're like looking at different angles? Yeah,

Unknown 53:56
yeah, that's a good point. Who are you looking at?

Unknown 53:58
I honestly, you have no idea.

Merlin 54:00
It just you're both we're both looking toward the central point for us, the viewer, which makes your faces look screwed on wrong. Look at you. And

Unknown 54:08
I know the very upsetting. There was an Oh, I just have such an upsetting picture of Max and it keeps crashing. This beta is what picture? Uh, it's actually from the inaugural Not, not the first

Unknown 54:30
ZVF con.

Unknown 54:34
And it was one it was like the first round of Snapchat folks being like, Oh, look, it's the gender swapping and the age the age aging type filters. Oh, yeah. Right. Right. Right. Free.

Unknown 54:46
I've always wanted to know what I would look like as an Asian teenager.

Merlin 54:50
Yeah, it's really Asian boy,

Unknown 54:52
not Asian boy. It's

Merlin 54:54
really bad. Oh, maybe this is the right link. Oh, there you go. Click that that doesn't require a login. This should work.

Unknown 55:00
I'm surprised that you've been doing this for so long. When we

Merlin 55:04
first got when I think I've got a kid and we did funny silly so there's one of me and my wife. I always end up looking like Getty Lee and a lot of these

Unknown 55:10
stuffed animals are very upsetting. I Oh, no. I don't like your little Why do you have all these little dolls? Merlin? Well, I have a daughter she has dolls. That is not that is not your daughter's dolls that I'm sure I've

Merlin 55:24
once kids and the other one is Rebecca.

Unknown 55:27
Mm hmm. Okay.

Unknown 55:28
I love this one with the this one with the goggles on there's no way you let your daughter play with that. goggles, goggles, goggles. That's the dolphin adult man.

Merlin 55:38
What are you talking about? No, no, no, no. Okay, so if you go up, those are two magnificent failures. Me face swapping with Miss Shawn from The Walking Dead. Not a great look.

Unknown 55:48
I don't think that's

Unknown 55:52
cancel.

Merlin 55:54
Cancel. Other one you're looking at is is me and what's your name? The Spider Man villain. Yeah, that's injured.

Unknown 56:02
No, no.

Unknown 56:05
It looks like you got shot with the homeless makeup gun.

Merlin 56:12
Creepy painting is. I tried to send this to you before but you know, oh my god. Look at max. Yeah, that's a painting that's been in my wife's family. there's a there's a girl and a boy, a brother and a sister that were painted in the 19th century. And she insists on having this goddamn thing in the house. And I think it is so terrifying. And then now we're stuck with it. But I do like the face swap with her because she's a beautiful girl. It's interesting. The Face Swap live and other garbage app. All these free to play apps are terrible.

Unknown 56:41
They swap live

Merlin 56:43
like well, I went I found a list tickle of the best face swap apps for iOS. So I tried this one. This is one of those apps. I guess I buy more apps that I realized, like anytime you do anything in this app, a full page ad pops up. It's mental. I sat on so the last time I was on a plane a few weeks ago there was this guy in like pseudo we're in student business class. And the guy in front of me. He's got he's super VC, old VC guy looking like he's reading books about he's another guy and probably as late 70s and he's reading these these books. He's got a stainless steel Apple watch with a with a nice band, you know, the link bracelet. And like he and his wife like the you know, they're like a cute older couple. And they obviously got some doubt. And I watched this man for an hour and a half probably play a video game that required him to close and add approximately every minute. It's just weird what people put up with for this stuff.

Unknown 57:46
I yeah, I mean, I I guess I get it. There's actually a new free to play game. What's it flappy? flappy Royale. And it's Flappy Bird. But you're playing with 100 other flap ease at the same time. And there's just always a banner ad at the bottom and you don't need it. And so something will pop up like Hey, you got an egg watching add it to an open, open the egg and then you get like an extra character or something. So you never need to be taken out of the app to watch something if you don't want to. But it just is very strange. This is Zach gage actually helped make this one too. And I like there's no way to give money to this app to get rid of them. Like I Oh really?

Merlin 58:35
Yeah, that wants to be an ad app.

Unknown 58:38
Yes. And that's what a lot of those I've we've talked about them before the rip off like catch app apps all of them have ads and you can't buy them for 99 cents or $1 because the ads make way more money that's so that's so intriguing

Merlin 58:52
to me because it just seems like ads and I don't know but it feels like the role of ads has become to serve as an annoyance historically to like get you to you know buy the full version or whatever Yeah Is that pretty? Pretty? Great?

Unknown 59:12
I put down my phone What am I gonna know

Unknown 59:18
what happens if you put one of those those age filters on

Merlin 59:21
Oh, I could do it let's see I can do it right now. I can do that man. I mean you know what I might still have I got to Facebook up all my all my things but I might still have it on here. No shit I do I still have face up on here. I sent them that I sent them to note the note to please delete all my data. And someone named like Natasha your data is very important to us. What should you make? Oh, you're doing age right?

Unknown 59:51
Yeah, I'm curious what happens okay,

Merlin 59:52

If you go to if you're in the face app we're not supposed to use you got a layouts. And then you can do for photos. So I'll do that. I'll do me as a pretty pretty lady. I'll do me hold. Oh, cool.
