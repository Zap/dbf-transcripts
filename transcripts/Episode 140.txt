Yeah, it would you agree that out of all the characters in Scott Pilgrim out of the all the amazing women, Anna Kendrick has to be number one, despite her very brief time in it. And it's just usually the hottest person any movie? Yeah, that's the thing. She just steals the spotlight. And she forgets like like there's this bit she does on Twitter where she she was like, Oh my god, I forgot. I was in Scott Pilgrim. And then oh my god, I just remembered I was in Twilight.

Unknown 8:21

Unknown 8:25
Yes. Okay. I mean,

Unknown 8:27
I ride a Segway Alex. So do I know you don't you write it in a row doesn't count 300 miles on this.

Unknown 8:37
I move so far out of the way so that I don't seem creepy to somebody. Mm hmm. I was trying my 13th and yesterday for some reason. My phone, I'm locked, not locked in lock, but isn't like, it doesn't want to go and I was trying to do the thing where you hold the buttons and do the thing. And half a block or on

Unknown 9:00
the phone where you gotta like put two in and then one on the side.

Unknown 9:04
We Yeah, we do the hard. Okay. Yeah. You remember from my very early early days on my anecdote about 13. Were like I couldn't even hard reboot. It was so fucked. Yes. I just wait for it to crash. Yep. Anyway, the point is, I was going to my favorite ATM. And I was I was scooting in my favorite ATM and three quarters of a block ahead of me. were two young women and a dog. And I think they were together. We're walking the dog. And they kept looking back. Because I kept pausing on my segway looking really annoyed when I looked at my phone. I think it might look like I was a creeper trying to take their picture on a Segway.

Unknown 9:41
pulled over for

Unknown 9:46
no libido.

Unknown 10:04
Alright, I know you go ahead now Who do you think is cute?

Unknown 10:09
Princess diary.

Unknown 10:10
Oh, I love princess diary. I love Anna.

Unknown 10:14
Do you think MMV Adams is cute? Oh. You didn't like what? He didn't like Captain Marvel. Ah.

Unknown 10:20
I know. I didn't. I'm really problematic. I really I watched it. It's not

Unknown 10:28
spicy.

Unknown 10:30
I never know what bite I'm gonna get with you. I know. I don't know. Anyway, if anybody wants to send me a libido please hit that bell and responding comments.

Unknown 10:39
Fuck me. Okay. All right.

Unknown 10:42
Okay. Well, iOS, iOS. Yeah, you have follow up. I have follow up. Oh, okay. Good. Your start. Yep.

Unknown 10:50
Yep. No. All right. I can start No, I can start I shall I am. So I don't know if this is going to start talking about this new tactic. This is the show is probably show Hello. I'm already back. So I love something I've wanted for so long. So on the phone. The reason I put it on my phone so down to my phone because I want my unknown calls to go to voicemail and it's been great. The other thing I've wanted for it which every phone should have that should be free on every phone is I don't get phone calls from people unless I've approved them. I didn't they shouldn't even be allowed to leave a voicemail. I think they should go to death. No

Unknown 11:22
interesting. Well, why don't you just not set up your voicemail?

Unknown 11:26
I got a kid and she might be dead somewhere. Ah, that is fair. Yes. Um, that's a good idea though. Uh, the other thing that they just added I heard this I've been watching a lot of videos and reading things about 13 wasn't like European men fingering their phones very quickly. Let's guys move fast. Their little skinny finger side by side. This is my thumb is doing this. But you can now delete apps from the update screen I said this in our private text channel. But this is fucking huge. I've wanted this for so you can get an update for an app and you're like, I hate this app. I don't use it anymore. I guess I better update and now if you slide right to left you can hit a delete button. Let me so have you done your updates today? I don't love the way I do not love at all the way they are doing updates now. I don't love that you have to go to like a modal pop up thing to get to it. I liked it better when it was Oh

Unknown 12:18
yeah. Yeah, just tap on your face. Yeah, manually.

Unknown 12:20
I'm a manual update or

Unknown 12:23
St. Well, same, same. Oh, it kind of works like testflight. Oh, interesting. It's very test for it. Huh? Yes. Oh, and you can even delete once it's been updated recently. And scrolling scrolling.

Unknown 12:36
Wow, I want to be positive about this. It does kind of feel like the kind of thing that should have been there forever. But thank you for adding that. I love that. And I'm saying listen, you can't run this on your phone. Unless it's for your work, but you're gonna love

Unknown 12:51
it we got we barely started.

Unknown 12:53
I know. I know. But please, please delete. Delete the apps.

Unknown 13:02
Okay, I'll try and make this quick.

Unknown 13:04
Alright, I'm here. Let's get let's get started. Yes.

Unknown 13:08
Alex, yes, dude, what particular wrath specifically will I incur for myself and my family if I upgrade, upgrade? reminders and our notes are the unusable

Unknown 13:24
Oh, interesting. reminders. You get

Unknown 13:27
a real you get a real like the kind of thing that Apple doesn't do very often. They're like, nope, seriously, don't do this until all these other devices you got update glass shark. You gotta update been Boy, you gotta update all your device name. Oh, my Oh, my devices. Let

Unknown 13:43
me ask you this to the system. So I started naming my devices recently because I have too many of them and I can't keep them straight. Like on iCloud. I have, you know, I went on and I was like, Oh my god, I have so many like old phones and things like, you know, in there. So I'm trying to come up with some sort of system to name all of I think

Unknown 14:00
there's a name for that we try to come up for like, for example, in the 90s I started naming every single Apple device after a Simpsons character and it would reveal something about one though I'm sure I'm the first person to ever do that. But like I mentioned, like my tiny tiny iPod Nano was Meg right? Yeah, so like, but I tried to have those auto there was lots you know, yeah, there's a name for that that I'll look up later. Will you name an array of things

Unknown 14:27
on your on your over your podcasting microphone? Is there a little picture of the iPod Nano and it's like do

Unknown 14:31
it for her Oh

Unknown 14:46
hello, Joe.

Unknown 14:56
We're apart with the cloud bed trying to find my array. So you're looking for an MRI I was going to show you mine and it's funny if I show it to you then explain the show

Unknown 15:05
I started so I just named everything names off of my cat names doc but now I can't remember which one is what exactly I do. Like I called my phone meatball and I do and I like that that's my favorite of the three I called my iPhone meatball.

Unknown 15:19
meatball is so cute.

Unknown 15:20
And now when I'm in my car it's like streaming off of meatball

Unknown 15:25
I sent you this is from not too long from April that's my that was my device list as

Unknown 15:33
well we're on the beta so it's not through yet. Od to answer your question yet do not update reminders if you actually use that with your family. Okay, cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Yep, yep, yep, no? Why am I not really why are we not getting this

Unknown 15:48
into the stupid Skype

Unknown 15:50
oh no the stupid Skype in another room. Quinn is in charge of the school

Unknown 15:55
stupid stupid

Unknown 15:57
stupid squint scooping all the Skype's

Unknown 16:00
you didn't get it you know where it is? It's probably me because for some reason on my production machine sending photos takes forever or never I don't know why but sometimes it just don't want to do

Unknown 16:14
Has anyone ever commented that I messages a little cranky

Unknown 16:18
every single day

Unknown 16:20
it can be in yesterday I think that feel like this has

Unknown 16:23
not been observed has not been observed.

Unknown 16:25
It's been observed I've noticed

Unknown 16:27
a lot of slow photo sending I message lately we're just sort of hangs and definitely

Unknown 16:32
okay. Exactly what I just said I got a Mac or on iOS as well.

Unknown 16:37
I'm from my phone on I message. Oh, wow. Okay, so yesterday for example, I was trying to message My magician friends I messaged group a picture of some cards that I was working on. And I took a couple pictures of video and I sent it to the SMS the boys in the chat and magic to the magic that's the name of the chat magic boys and then you have a top hat

Unknown 17:02
Yeah, we demand to be taken seriously

Unknown 17:07
and my pictures signed the two photos of some cards and a an old video and I sent and it was it had that little bar you know where it's like sending sending sending say sending sending a letter and it was it was just fucking hanging there and I and I walked away and I came back after like six or seven minutes it was still just like sending, sending sending. So then I just I was like, Damn, this is weird. And then I just did it again. Right? So I like put the same pictures and video in the message and just hit send again. And then all of a sudden just sort of diary it out all six very quickly. I know I spoke I caught in the lint trap and then I had to shake them all loose. But then it said to have everything

Unknown 17:44
happen.

Unknown 17:45
It happened because max I assume has his video stuff on like to record in a what's the default right now? I think the default is for a no I think it's

Unknown 17:57
Yeah, mines 4k.

Unknown 17:58
Yeah. And so as you sending the video, it's compressing like in real time and it's going slow. But so the second video What

Unknown 18:05
do you I happen to know that the video is exactly only seven seconds long.

Unknown 18:09
The world still needs to compress it like it's still It doesn't matter. Just photos. Yeah,

Unknown 18:15
there were two pictures and it wouldn't send the pictures either.

Unknown 18:17
I just the photo I just sent you from my phone has already arrived. Yes.

Unknown 18:20
Yes. Okay, if you're so smart. Oh, compression like okay, think you're so smart about video codecs. I don't mean that. Why didn't work with the pictures have you? What do you mean? Why did it work with wider? The pictures go? Because it doesn't go. You sent it all at one of

Unknown 18:37
my grandkids respond to me on Facebook. I don't

Unknown 18:43
that's my devices. Do you see a pattern?

Unknown 18:45
I OK, there we are.

Unknown 18:48
Oh, my name maybe I should name all of my devices some sort of a nice

Unknown 18:54
phone is me fall. And then and then the iPad what would the what would be like so then I have iPad which be some sort of meat and the lamb contain

Unknown 19:02
different different meat items.

Unknown 19:04
So the laptop would be like the Zeppelin Merlin with the remember we went we went to the steak house. We got the Zeppelin of meat came to our table. Yeah, you could you could call it rib roast. Yes. Okay. Okay, now we're fucking cooking with fire. All right. Yeah, yeah, we go.

Unknown 19:17
What's the flattest? So what was

Unknown 19:19
that? What did we have? We had a rib roast and it came in the Zeppelin

Unknown 19:23
Bros. I made the perfect rib roast the other night. Finally I've mastered it. I finally mastered it, I think but we've done this. Sushi I did. I went up to 133. Because middle bit little bit loose. If I don't if I do it below 130. I did 133 for like eight hours. And it was amazing. It was like perfect, like edge to edge for the first time per perfect edge edge medium rare. And then reheating shit dog. It's all about the reheating. You reheat it to one degree below. Whatever you cook that and it's amazing.

Unknown 19:56
Did you guys see the news about cold pasta? It was really interesting. I think we need to get Siracusa on this but basically so someone measured in a lab they were doing that testing people's like, fuck now I'm now I don't know what I'm talking about? Is it maybe it's their glycemic index? Is that your blood sugar after you eat something?

Unknown 20:20
I don't know. But yeah, I know what you're talking about. It's the thing you want it you want to find low low glycemic foods, because it's the kind of sugar that gets into your system more slowly. hypoglycemic is how you spike and get on diabetes.

Unknown 20:32
Correct. So if you

Unknown 20:36
like if you like Alex, and you just have a piece of white car basically,

Unknown 20:40
like it's like simple sugar, right?

Unknown 20:43
Yes, sir. Yeah, yeah, like to sit in a tub of apple butter.

Unknown 20:49
So they eat a bunch of pasta. If you take it right out of the pot, and you eat it right now. It was just cooked it up. It makes your blood sugar go way up, because it turns into sugar right away. Right, right. But if you let the pasta sit and get cold and like refrigerated overnight, and then you eat the pasta, it does not make your blood sugar go way up in the same way. It's more like a complex carbohydrate.

Unknown 21:12
That sounds like an MSG kind of thing. That's crazy.

Unknown 21:16
Wait and check this out. Then they were then someone was like, Well, is it the temperature? What is it so they were right, let's reheat it. And you would expect that if you reheat it, it would make your blood sugar go crazy again, right? It would turn back into simple right? But no, if you reheat it, it's even better. It makes your blood sugar go up even less. Isn't that weird? That's

Unknown 21:36
an article on the BBC from 2014, reheated pasta less fattening.

Unknown 21:42
This. This sounds like an O magazine type of situation.

Unknown 21:47
I woke up this morning and re listen to the This American Life Episode about MSG. And it's still very very good.

Unknown 21:53
I have never heard that.

Unknown 21:55
SG it's really good because it's got it's got a double turns out.

Unknown 21:58
Oh, love that. That guy was crazy. Because

Unknown 22:01
you know, you know people have been saying for years. Oh my god, that guy was sick. I'm so glad he's not my crazy uncle, Dr. Steel, which is a hot name. But um, yeah, yeah. So So what whatever, whatever actually happened in the late 60s involving that letter to the New England Journal of Medicine, or, or as he put it, that medicine journal, you know, in New England, because he's 90 here, but

Unknown 22:25
I saw this I saw this article about the pasta. Sorry, Merlin. You were in the middle of a story.

Unknown 22:29
No, I was gonna say was MSG isn't bad. You're off at lying and faking

Unknown 22:33
doctor's name. He came up with

Unknown 22:36
it. Because like he was claiming that it was a joke on like, total crock of shit. Right? It was like, Whoa, whoa, whoa. He came up with a with a ping pong name.

Unknown 22:47
Yeah, it was very ping pong. So I found this on on Reddit, which is where I get all my medical and science news.

Unknown 22:56
Health and food safe. And yeah,

Unknown 22:57
and I started reading it and it says coolly positive for 24 hours reduces calories and insulin response while also turning into a prebiotic. And these were positive effects only intensify if you reheat it. And that doesn't help

Unknown 23:09
if you have it with Soylent.

Unknown 23:11
I think so. And, and then I went into the comments and it seems to be people seem to be corroborating it.

Unknown 23:19
Well, if it's on Reddit, then I mean that's that's peer reviewed. So what has anybody tried to do this like a I would love it if someone did like a supersize me of carbs, like which the like a documentary like okay, I'm only going to eat this specific carb for one month. Let's see how fat I get and then but a doctor has to monitor you because after a month of eating just carbs, your body is probably going to acclimate to it right so yeah, let's say you have one month of hot pasta every single day and then the second month you have one you have pasta, but it is cold and then be Wow.

Unknown 24:01
And then like the third month you have positive that has cooled and then Ben read it.

Unknown 24:05
Yeah, so you're either just gonna get fatter and fatter, but you're gonna get fatter

Unknown 24:10
1000 times like Oh, yeah.

Unknown 24:17
You did on dragon glass.

Unknown 24:19
I think we need to get circus on this set of cool. So

Unknown 24:23
that's really pretty much all I had. The other thing is I'm gonna figure out how to follow radar. So

Unknown 24:27
I'm eating so I think if we call this the Siracusa method I think what you're supposed to do is you're supposed to have the cold pasta with a pre diced garlic that you get a Costco

Unknown 24:38
Oh yeah, hundred percent Yes. And then get some shaker cheese.

Unknown 24:44
You can always subs if you don't have ricotta cheese. Just use yogurt. That's what I do.

Unknown 24:47
Merlin I'll go I'll back you up here. The shaker cheese is good. I'm under no illusions that it's Parmesan cheese. It's like it's almost its own thing.

Unknown 24:55
I like to pick a Reno Romano Pecorino Romano

Unknown 24:57
but but the shaker cheese is almost all genre of genomic

Unknown 25:01
this cool chairs.

Unknown 25:02
It's like Velveeta like it's just a different?

Unknown 25:05
It's like I would say it's like it's like Chipotle I like I am I'm under no illusions I do not think that

Unknown 25:12
Mexican food

Unknown 25:15
is its own its own thing I enjoy

Unknown 25:16
been reheated on premises. Yeah. That's pretty big deal if you think about it.

Unknown 25:23
I think when I was on food say I was recently on the podcast that we all know and love food safety talk. So good. Both of the i think that i think Professor Chapman and Dr. Don both said that they don't they wouldn't eat at your Poli

Unknown 25:37
wow

Unknown 25:39
I love what Professor Chapman said about salad blew my mind I never thought about it you talk about him fucking turns out I don't know if you heard this Alex but Professor Chapman said something so smart. And we already talked about this

Unknown 25:51
No, I have

Unknown 25:52
not heard this episode yet. Max was asking one of his typically very very strange obsessive questions and long story short what Chapman said was there are certain in places where he's gone in and looked at the he he'll look at the code or the score that a place got you know from the health department. And obviously if it's terrible he won't go but basically what he's saying is like let's put it this way. These are my words not here is if you go to the county fair, or whatever, and you have your choice between like a corn dog onion ring on a stick that's recently been fried versus is a July day you have that versus a salad get survivor salad bar

Unknown 26:35
we've got cool

Unknown 26:41
on salted diabetic salt

Unknown 27:01
bullets Yeah, it's like there's so much shit that can go bad and a salad go wrong. Go break bad salad Breaking Bad.

Unknown 27:08
I recently got a big tub of spinach from the grocery store and I've been I've been working my way through it and saute it down to a tablespoon. I've been making making a healthy spinach salad for myself, but I I recently went and made a salad and I was trying to get some food into my body and as quick and I I just straight up forgot to wash it. I just took a big

Unknown 27:28
Oh no, I took a big, big

Unknown 27:31
wad of spinach out of the thing. And I put in the bowl and I toss it with some dressing. And I just chow down on it. And about an hour later I was sitting there like playing computer games or something and I was thinking about I don't know why it popped into my head and it but I was like oh my god, I didn't watch that spinach. I was like I might die

Unknown 27:47
like realizing you forgot to wipe or something. I might

Unknown 28:05
It's like you're not really you're not supposed to do it but lots of people do it and they're okay but you can't

Unknown 28:09

Unknown 28:21
Rebecca be my wife washes everything well you don't get anything that's pre washed she didn't trust that she puts into that thing as usual. She doesn't spinner she was real real

Unknown 28:30
I get a little to now the greens I get are they're called triple washed and it says we wash it says triple washed we watched it so you don't have to you're saying I'm am I being connected to believe it? Is that am I getting caught by Whole Foods?

Unknown 28:43
I see I if it's just for me like I'm not even I know I will get in trouble if I didn't watch that if it's something I'm giving my daughter but like if it's just me and it says washed and the thing is if you get one of those phone

Unknown 28:54
What if it says what if it says triple washed triple washed

Unknown 28:59
well i mean what is washing

Unknown 29:05
up in court? I understand correctly This is washed through champs could you walk me through your process

Unknown 29:13
go through a tumble dry

Unknown 29:20
and then the truck driver just pees on all the box

Unknown 29:22
you're saying you're saying it says on there it says we washed washed

Unknown 29:29
now what they're gonna say is I don't remember putting that on

Unknown 29:33
it's like drunk driving or you know or our or you know or shoplifting. Alright so I'm going to victim

Unknown 29:40
cry I'm going to call my iPhone meatball

Unknown 29:43
go to Home Depot and you steal something well okay, I'd like for your plants

Unknown 29:48
it's not I don't think it's if you if you go into the if you need one nut and you just slip it in your pocket I don't think that's right.

Unknown 29:59
For that be spoken hipster store called one nut

Unknown 30:03
$76 wouldn't

Unknown 30:06
stand by this I just I can't it's not really a logical

Unknown 30:09
all you need is like an eyeglasses screw they don't even want to run your credit card for that shit right?

Unknown 30:13
I don't it's not i'm not making like our largest saving

Unknown 30:16
that you're literally saving them money on processing fees. I'm not

Unknown 30:19
making a logical point here but it's more about just I know it when I see it. You know it's like pornography. I know when I see it and I know the take as well

Unknown 30:27
situation pay for pornography.

Unknown 30:29
I know that taking one not from Home Depot is not stealing. Does anyone agree with me?

Unknown 30:36
Especially if you do it often if your regular customers just

Unknown 30:38
giving me a face. Okay, well,

Unknown 30:42
listen, I know that I'm right. I know that. Stealing.

Unknown 30:45
here's here's the thing. I think it's stealing but I do not think it's wrong.

Unknown 30:52
Yeah, so it's, it's not even.

Unknown 30:57
not technically stealing.

Unknown 31:00
They know if they don't see it or No.

Unknown 31:02
Okay. Uh huh. Just like

Unknown 31:07
it's less than one cent.

Unknown 31:09
It's Oh, it's so much less. You're

Unknown 31:11
getting a bag of 500 knots for $1 if you buy a hue bulb, yes a year.

Unknown 31:15
I'm more than makes up for all the screws.

Unknown 31:18
Dear one, they want to sell me a burlap sack full of nuts for $1

Unknown 31:26
they want to give me a wholesale

Unknown 31:31
cost per not is less than a penny. And I think

Unknown 31:37
Yeah, and if it's a little I just don't think it's theft. No.

Unknown 31:42
Uh huh.

Unknown 31:44
It's like having one Olive from the salad bar at the grocery store. Right? If you rang if I rang that all of up if I was like one hour please guess what the scale would say zero dollars and zero cents it wouldn't register any way

Unknown 31:58
you know, when we're when we're waiting in line somewhere for likely we have a regular my daughter and I have a regular ice cream date on Fridays. And, and we get the same thing every time. And it's Friday ice cream and special thing we do. And and the kids the teens in front of us at the gelato place really exhaust the resources of this place on samples from tiny spoons. And I really do wish there a way I could say I'm a cash paying money guy and I overtip could the teens Can I just sweep the teens aside you know what kind of money that place is, is there should be a place where you just go get get your free ice cream not act like it's a sample, there should just be a place where you can steal ice cream. So people like to follow my logic. They should have a special door out of which max can walk with a single Nutter screw. Yeah, so tie up the lines for the people who want to spend money.

Unknown 32:47
Okay, it's like

Unknown 32:49
a store and you open up the ice cream and you have one lick off the top of the pint of ice

Unknown 32:54
they can't even tell you put the plastic back on top. I opened the hydrogen peroxide today and it didn't have seal

Unknown 33:02
I'm not sure if I should fix that problem.

Unknown 33:12
So all right so I've got so I've got my iPhone is meatball and my MacBook Pros rib roast and now I've got the Apple Watch which is smaller than a meatball and the iPad which is bigger than the meatball but smaller than the right

Unknown 33:23
what are those tiny things? roulette relay relay like what are those tiny or like little chicken you

Unknown 33:30
know that would be so cute nugget

Unknown 33:32
nugget. Hmm Okay, yep, we got nugget meatball rib roast and what's my iPad gonna be? What's the flattest of the meats?

Unknown 33:42
veal.

Unknown 33:46
Youngest

Unknown 33:49
we've got like a tomahawk steak.

Unknown 33:55
How about how about this one to be cute like a cat?

Unknown 33:58
Yeah, I think I think a cat name

Unknown 34:00
is a flat iron but let's see

Unknown 34:04
you can name a cat fight arm but it would have to be one of those like it have to have like a fucked up face like one of those rescue cats.

Unknown 34:10
Yeah. The Broken punched ones. Yeah,

Unknown 34:12
and you call you call them flat iron. Yeah.

Unknown 34:18
Yeah, you're getting your money hisses at you. that's bigger than a meatball but smaller than a rib roast.

Unknown 34:24
Is there a technical term for like a slice of ham like what it what is a slice name of something? Oh, filet

Unknown 34:34
wasn't restaurant I can slice a prosciutto? Maybe that's what I call it.

Unknown 34:40
Joe and rib roast?

Unknown 34:44
OO Parma ham OBQ the fancy Spanish ham

Unknown 34:48
maybe I'll call it for shooter de Parma

Unknown 34:56
I was thinking about that. I was thinking

Unknown 34:59
how many names of things I don't know what causes that bit to flip in my head when I hear that particular rhythm in a word. But like I don't know why. This to me when I hear rhythm

Unknown 35:12
that we got it we've got a running the cards up the writers we have a running joke that we just called.

Unknown 35:18
What does it

Unknown 35:34

Unknown 35:40
Quinn

Unknown 35:45
Quinn wasn't available to direct our episode of Dubai Friday.

Unknown 35:47
No Quinn Quinn is not available to Quinn has worked at it. I know Cameron is unavailable today. Quinn. Quinn behind the curtain this is this is very good. This was a very last minute situation. Although Quinn had the same situation this morning that I did. Max Did you know that today is not a work holiday? For cards? Yeah, yes, I didn't. I thought the rapture it happened came in this morning like oh, I'm not ready for this. And then I just kind of sat around for a while.

Unknown 36:21
If you like that come it's all pants and skirts on the ground and let collars from cats and you're like oh shit. It happened. That rap shirt. I'm left fine.

Unknown 36:31

Unknown 36:54
Why is this talk is how do you change the name of your computer? It's under sharing, right? No, it should be under user profile.

Unknown 37:02
No, it's under I believe computer name is a setting under sharing. I book sharing. You click on sharing and not

Unknown 37:09
Yeah, well it used to be Yeah, that used to be one way. That's how

Unknown 37:12
I can change my username on the computer. But that's not what I'm trying to do.

Unknown 37:16
Oh so do you want to just

Unknown 37:18
doo doo doo doo doo doo go to the top level and just hit enter? Like air up up up up up into your all the way up in my case Macintosh HD cuz I'm old school so

Unknown 37:27
your look you want to change the name of Oh, yeah, there you go too. Well, recording rib roast.

Unknown 37:32
No, it's my God. He's not controlling the Quinn's got all the Bros.

Unknown 37:37
Bros. Bros. All right. All right. Game Controller I don't actually care. We can talk about other things. You guys wanna start the show?

Unknown 37:45
Yeah.

Unknown 37:47
We've been saying a lot lately max. In a science data mind these days.

Unknown 37:50
tired today? I did a lot of magic last night.

Unknown 37:55
George some shower Stranger Things you actually watch the whole thing? Yeah, I'm not I don't think I'm doing Yeah, well,

Unknown 38:00
I got to the last like 15 minutes I got to the like, what I think is probably the big ending. And I was like, should I should just go to bed and just painted miniatures and watch Netflix all day.

Unknown 38:09
I did not care for Stranger Things. Season Two, I felt that they were doing sort of thing I've complained about on Dubai Friday before which is what I would call it checkmark filmmaking, where they're sort of like, before they write the season, they're like okay, they put a bunch of checkboxes down and like Okay, we got to write it so that it checks all these boxes. And I don't think that's I really resent watching Season Two just be clear Season Two I really resent watching media like that. And I did not think Season Two of Stranger Things was very good. And then season three I was really into I thought it was great. And I thought they were able to

Unknown 38:40
the pacing was relentless was so fun.

Unknown 38:42
Yeah, I thought they really got out. I thought that they were like very creatively liberated from the burden of recreating season one and and it was much more fun to watch

Unknown 38:51
the end like and just the ways that I don't know the characters, I've got to get so interesting. And for the most part, like got to be very interesting and do their own thing and like group up. But you know, one thing that sucks sometimes in a popular space Wars franchise is you're like, why the team break up and go to different places like that usually sucks and you can pull it off but like we make the team go to different places for to for like the whole movie, and it sucks. But in this case, it was groups of people that were doing different things. And then in the end like a symphony, it kind of all comes together. I don't spoil it, but I thoroughly enjoyed this season. I like this kids. Oh, just the relationship between the the

Unknown 39:31
net but that Nope, nope, nope, nope.

Unknown 39:33
Maximum watch the live Erica. Who's Erica? can't spell America without Erica.

Unknown 39:37
Oh, yeah. She's great.

Unknown 39:39
She knew.

Unknown 39:40
I think so. That's Lucas's sister.

Unknown 39:43
And I saw Merlin I really liked you as the mayor this season. I thought you had a great performance.

Unknown 40:02
What should he puts up with and the stuff that he's in?

Unknown 40:05
He's in saw

Unknown 40:06
I every time I saw I forget that he's in saw. Oh, it was the finger chopper bit. A little riff on saw was that like a sort of a fourth wall?

Unknown 40:15
Oh my god, the riffs and there's um, you know, Alex see this so we can talk about it. There's so many references in this. They have gone completely over the top with the references. And I'm not gonna say it. What I can watch TV today.

Unknown 40:29
I was

Unknown 40:32
stupid. What is this just occurred to me but it's really obvious.

Unknown 40:35
I mean, I'm I don't know if that was I think the relentless Russian pursuer is very clearly a reference to a popular franchise that started in 1984. I think the

Unknown 40:47
Terminator.

Unknown 40:48
Yes. Looks like him. Oh my god. Okay.

Unknown 40:53
Watch TV. So have you tried a game controller? I was 13 yet?

Unknown 40:58
I have not No. Okay.

Unknown 41:01
I don't play that many games on iPad. I think it'd be fun for my kid. We need to do that for Minecraft.

Unknown 41:06
I'm excited. I don't know. I think we talked about this a while ago. I feel like game developers are kind of split 5050 on the whole Apple arcade thing.

Unknown 41:15
And who's gonna most benefit in terms of developers? Big developer?

Unknown 41:21
Like Dino?

Unknown 41:22
I think medium like like the

Unknown 41:27
like the monument valleys of the world like those this tiny design studio. What about Zach, you think it's good for Zach? I don't know. I actually have not talked to him about this. I don't know.

Unknown 41:37
Have you seen the C?

Unknown 41:38
Max we are throwing to you to get a name. It is not as fun the

Unknown 41:43
changing the name of my phone.

Unknown 41:44
Oh, go. I apologize. Apple. is Apple arcade. Good for friends. That game? Oh,

Unknown 41:52
yeah, I talked to Well, I can't say if it was Zach or not Zach. But I talked to a developer who we know who is you're launching some title.

Unknown 42:01
All right.

Unknown 42:02
Okay. And I said, Hey, is this a good deal? I mean, because how does it work? Exactly. And so essentially, I mean, the basics of it are the more people that play your game, I think the more piece of the pie you get, but also, they'll give you a bunch of money to make a really cool iOS game. And I will say funding iOS games is a real challenge. Like if you want to make an ambitious iOS game, like it's very hard to get money up front and you just don't know what's going to be it's very crowded platform so it's very hard to tell if your thing is going to be a hit or not.

Unknown 42:34
If you don't make it really fast it's going to be really tough if you don't have a huge first day Isn't that like you're kind of doomed a little bit unlike unlike Kickstarter as we learned from you, but isn't it is that part of the problem if you don't have a big first week?

Unknown 42:45
Yeah, that's that's possible. I mean, probably the fall off is pretty steep because I think it tends to be pretty fatty you know, like people get into something and then they forget about it but no, I think developers seem to be fairly I thought for sure someone was getting ripped off or something some sort of rod yield what was happening with know from everything I can tell people can be pretty pretty happy about this.

Unknown 43:04
That's that's what it seemed like at WWDC, but I feel like ever since the Marlin Do you know about the ridiculous fishing? cloning incident?

Unknown 43:15
Just the one with the this $10 a week app?

Unknown 43:18
No, no, there is. There's this amazing game called ridiculous fishing. Max. tweet this tweet link the story for me

Unknown 43:27
to sneeze I was hoping you would tell

Unknown 43:28
Okay, uh, me.

Unknown 43:32
Oh, so

Unknown 43:35
that was that was a moist one.

Unknown 43:39
Dad sees

Unknown 43:42
that and then you don't find you know, there's a booger but you don't find it for a couple hours.

Unknown 43:50
bottom of my chin.

Unknown 43:51
Look at that guy that will fell off.

Unknown 43:54
At some point, I think I think there's something hormonal the changes when you become a father or you scream every time you see it.

Unknown 44:07
Enjoy being dad.

Unknown 44:11
So

Unknown 44:13
So

Unknown 44:16
yeah, Ronnie, Ronnie, and Zach and

Unknown 44:18
Greg, and actually max

Unknown 44:23
ridiculous fishing. So it started with bland beer means it's like flash game ridiculous fishing,

Unknown 44:28
which is a game studio. That's great.

Unknown 44:29
And the blue flame beer is Yeah. And and it was like a browse. I think it was like a browser game. And the premise is like you fish, it's a fishing game, like your hook goes down to the ocean, and you catch a bunch of fish and then you pull them up. But then the twist is you throw them way up into the air and they fly way up into the air and you have a machine gun, you shoot the fish and you get money for all the ones you shoot. So it's just sort of a dumb, like, funny premise. And then, so they got a bunch of friends together, including our friend Zack and Greg and GW and and we're all like indie developers. They made this sort of like, you know, super, super band of indie developers, and they adapted ridiculous fishing for iOS. It's out now it's tons tons of fundaments, one of the classic iOS games like the art styles. Unbelievable. It's

Unknown 45:15
any top 10 lists. Yeah,

Unknown 45:16
you'll see it I can't recommend it more highly if you haven't played it, but basically they soon as they started showing it a game shows, you know, bring it to GTC and stuff. Some guys saw it, and was like, Oh, I can make that game and made and made it and put it on called ninja fishing. And just put it on the App Store. Like before they beat them to market and his game was such a turd like it suck like the controls felt bad and bad. Like it was just like the shiniest worst clone. But you know, he did the thing where you fish the fish and you pull them out of the ocean filling them up in the air and you have guns and you shoot them. And on paper, it sounds similar. But you know, when games execution is everything, right? Like is it like it wasn't balanced? It wasn't like didn't have a good progression, like it was not fun to play didn't feel good. So but by the time ridiculous edition came out, like a lot of the air got sucked out of the room by this first one. And it was hard for them to build up a lot of excitement about it. So cloning is a is a disaster. And

Unknown 46:10
I see like it was sort of like with with that one numbers game that was really popular. 10 Well,

Unknown 46:15
that also was that's also one of Greg. Also one of Greg's games, Greg.

Unknown 46:19
VR for three. Was it 1024? was it called

Unknown 46:21
net 2048 2048. Okay,

Unknown 46:24
yeah. So they made threes. And then Oh, what's that? Right? Okay, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Okay.

Unknown 46:31
Oh, yes, love threes,

Unknown 46:34
made threes. I was an early beta tester. f3 is before it was threes when I was had a whole different mechanics. And I was playing it the whole the whole way and watching the development. I mean, this thing is such a an interesting, like torture development. I mean, so it was then cracking that game format was fascinating to watch. They've since published all the like emails of their process. And it's, it's pretty wild to read through

Unknown 46:54
Oh, I saw that. Yeah, their decision making about all the different little tiny pieces, the faces and every

Unknown 47:00
because like, it was crazy. Like they, they didn't know what that game was until they knew what it was. And then all of a sudden it was threes. And you're like, Oh, well, obviously threes like this was inevitable. But it wasn't inevitable. They had to make it that way. So anyhow, they did that. And then as soon as that came out, some shitty catch app company that just does rip offs made this thing called 2048. It was like the junkie highest worst rip off of threes. You can beat 2048 by just swiping up into the left continuously and then great. You beat it. Congratulations, close your eyes. You can like you can be done.

Unknown 47:34
That's that's exactly my kids strategy for threes.

Unknown 47:37
fast as possible until the game ends

Unknown 47:41
for three years, but not for very good. No, no, yeah, you can get through a few rounds like that. But anyhow, yeah, it was a bummer. And 2048 was free. So it's sort of it's sort of drink their milk shake, you know,

Unknown 47:53
at at WWDC, there were people, I don't want to say there were people with Apple who worked there and who had been brought in to the app arcade thing, but they actively were like, No, we are going to work for we had gone to work for big studios, because you know, we've worked on this iOS game forever, but we don't want to release it. And like we like we don't want to, we can't play test it at game shows, because people will clone it. So we don't know if it's good or not. But then we also, you know, we don't have any money. So apples, basically throwing money at things like the same way they are at TV shows to just and just see what sticks.

Unknown 48:28
Right? I forgot about that part. They're investing some in these.

Unknown 48:32
Yeah, they're just paying developers to make games. And then it ends up being like a Spotify type thing where you are like a YouTube bread where you get more revenue if people play your game more. I don't know. I'm excited.

Unknown 48:47
So it's, it's Netflix for games and like Netflix is good for all of the bad disruption that Netflix is doing. There's good things too, because I know lots of people, I think we all know lots of people who got some sort of Netflix original, and it's like, well, who who else would have taken a gamble on this person? Right? So that's the that's the good side of what Apple's doing with this games thing is like, you know, Apple's going to take a bet on all these cool game developers and be like, let's see what happens if we give you like a millions of dollars a budget and you make this like awesome game. But then you know, it's only available for people who are subscribers, right? Did you guys subscribe to Apple

Unknown 49:20
news? I did the trial and then quickly cancelled it.

Unknown 49:26
Yep. Why I hate it. I didn't say so much I canceled on me. I hate apple. This. I hate that I hate the people I love like max. And john Dickerson post links to things that tries to open up Apple news, which

Unknown 49:39
says I hate Apple news so much.

Unknown 49:42
I having to walk into a closet to watch TV.

Unknown 49:45
I have a hard

Unknown 49:47
hard time but then you're not on the court. there's a there's a an outlet in there. You can only watch TV in there. And then let's talk about

Unknown 50:42
And the word the most important salting things that it goes like based on your trends. Here's a story you would like and it's like, God, you just fucking insult you spitting in my face.

Unknown 50:52
Twitter, Twitter moments is I've said this every week for how long is really it's just about killing me. I mean, the first of all, I mean, let's go number two, the fucking black lady reaction just where we going with this where we How much longer are we going to continue to make? And then Black lady reaction chest and you know what I'm talking about? Right? This whole genre of like black lady having a snapping reaction to something. I don't think it's all black ladies who are posting this. And I think it's kind of weird. I think it's kind of weird.

Unknown 51:20
Oh, no, it is all white suburban moms or just people.

Unknown 51:24
It's Yes, it gets worse. But I'm I'm so fucking confused when I'll just see a first name of somebody and I'm like, What the What the fuck? What it'll it'll say like, you know, shampoo. I'll be like, what's shampoo? Click on it. I'm here to see why shampoo is trending. I thought shampoo is dead. I'm like, What the fuck is shampoo? I keep going in that I guess it's a name of a YouTuber cheating on his girlfriend. I don't fucking know. You're gonna scroll and scroll and scroll through the

Unknown 51:54
shampoo is what the fuck well there's this thing now of a trending spam so there there was this thing? Oh, like

Unknown 52:01
the Terry style thing?

Unknown 52:04
Yep, yep. And not my area was was the thing because I was like made up right?

Unknown 52:10
Yeah, well, they were just trying to dunk on people who didn't want black arrow fucking stupid you have to be

Unknown 52:15
to be honest. I think there's bad people on both sides. I actually think both sides are really annoying. And obviously the people who are like not my area or the are actually demons like I mean, these people are too stupid to be alive. Like, if you're mad, it's it's insane. You're mad about the casting of a change.

Unknown 52:35
It's meta mad backlash man I think

Unknown 52:37

The first time I had one girl It was like a joke and I was making fun any better and now it's 25 years later I still go

Unknown 1:01:10
Yeah. Oh, yeah. It was a rebroadcast. I love it when someone owns Terry good not owns Terry Gross, but

Unknown 1:01:16
Well, I mean, Terry Terry was trying but she was Oh, how does one saying this generation virtuously? But she thought she knew the file card to pull on Liz. Oh, that was gonna be like, Oh, I'm a fellow traveler on this. And this was like, No, I am cute. Like

Unknown 1:01:36
I'm cute. Like, no, no, it's not a statement. I think I'm hot.

Unknown 1:01:42
Yeah, but if you really feel like you're speaking for other women, she's like

Unknown 1:01:48
she's not she's not being mean. botteri doesn't let up Terry is Terry thesis, she's going to 1978 her way through this and like it doesn't.

Unknown 1:01:58
It was the whole thing. And she's like, you know, some people might say that rapping flute just don't go together.

Unknown 1:02:09
For bands. Like

Unknown 1:02:15
I love I love her self confidence. And she feels like

Unknown 1:02:18
she's showing up the shell. She's chewing up the shy.

Unknown 1:02:20
Oh, no. She feels no need to humble brag. She just stopped the fact she's like, Look, I'm a classically trained musician. And I'm really good.

Unknown 1:02:34
Yeah, I'm a big girl plays the flute fucking deal. Oh, God,

Unknown 1:02:39
her songs are so good. She's so so good. And they're different. They're all different on that record. They are crazy. You probably haven't heard it but that's a very good record.

Unknown 1:02:48
I mean, you probably weren't around for the phone song but I was there for the phone song The phone song was my ringtone i'd love Yeah, what the hell are these little buttons for I didn't know what Luba towns where

Unknown 1:03:02
I didn't know what a Birkin bag was.

Unknown 1:03:04
How's it how's it going with with your with your influencer max how she doing? Yeah, just googling her now Oh no, this is how it starts.

Unknown 1:03:14
And Instagram was almost 4 million followers to her account began allowing her fans to purchase her bath water for $30 a bottle

Unknown 1:03:22
with herself that she

Unknown 1:03:24
selling out within three days

Unknown 1:03:26
she should go in Shark Tank She needs a packer

Unknown 1:03:31
disclaimer for the products on the I don't want to say they're in the Instagram was online store stated this water is not for drinking and should only be used for sentimental purposes

Unknown 1:03:41
ON

Unknown 1:03:43
tweeted so my bath water sold out WTF I will be making some more soon but it's been honestly a weird couple of days taking so many baths.

Unknown 1:04:01
Sheila I don't think she held all of her a

Unknown 1:04:09
sentimental purposes,

Unknown 1:04:12
but others praised her ability to sell seemingly anything to her audience quote honestly, we love a capitalist Queen that manages to market and sell bathwater one person

Unknown 1:04:22
wanted to make money.

Unknown 1:04:24
You ruined it. This is actually pretty funny. This is not the first on the Instagram star has pulled in June this person told her followers that she would make an account on the popular adult website porn hub when her photo received over 1 million likes. When the image attracted that number. She went ahead and created an account but rather than show anything sexual, she posted a number of strange non explicit ideas. Such as cutie pie goes all the way inside this person. And minute long clip of her eating a picture of Swedish YouTube star cutie pie

Unknown 1:04:55
OCO

Unknown 1:05:00
girl situation. She's fucking shit up.

Unknown 1:05:02
She's, she's great. Yeah, the question was a lot.

Unknown 1:05:07
is so it is she is doing kind of,

Unknown 1:05:11
well, no, she she knows her audience she knows who she is playing to the question wasn't like is she doing a commentary? The question was like her audience and I think like 3 million of those people are absolutely 100% sincere want to come in her bathwater, but there but there are also people like say Max, who suddenly gets like sunk into her Instagram poll and will be like, yeah, I'll put $5 towards her. Whatever her porn channel will be. And that's how that's how she gets it.

Unknown 1:05:42
We're going to sound silly Allison. It sounds I mean, it's always sound smart. But we're gonna sound

Unknown 1:05:48
like six months. We're gonna be like, are they? I think wheels are a sin against

Unknown 1:05:57
so fucking stupid.

Unknown 1:06:09
Reading the reading

Unknown 1:06:22
Oh, my

Unknown 1:06:27
women's hair should be donated to single men and unmarked.

Unknown 1:06:34
This is unbelievable. I feel like I just turned over a rock and there's like millipedes under here.

Unknown 1:06:39
I mean, she's she's just the next generation of stamp stamping girl like that's what it is. It's

Unknown 1:06:50
a section but it's kind of our but it's ironic

Unknown 1:06:53
if you reach a certain age all sex things are ironic

Unknown 1:06:55
Max, you're literally doing it right now.

Unknown 1:07:00
KT with her content. And eventually she's she's gonna like flip the tables and like run for office or something and then it won't be funny anymore. But

Unknown 1:07:08
still Oh, she could so be like the king of Italy or whatever they have. They're

Unknown 1:07:17
worse than normal today. Why don't they

Unknown 1:07:19
donate women to single men?

Unknown 1:07:24
This is why murders.

Unknown 1:07:28
So

Unknown 1:07:30
shall

Unknown 1:07:36
I go ahead, let's say let's hear it.

Unknown 1:07:42
That's okay, that's I couldn't I didn't even I was gonna say that. I couldn't find it. But I didn't even look at Max.

Unknown 1:07:48
Max, we already I think have something slightly prepared for this eventuality.

Unknown 1:07:53
You're gonna have to explain it.

Unknown 1:07:55
Actually, I should tell you we have a special guest to tell you about this episode of Blue's Clues. And that's going to be Alex Cox.

Unknown 1:08:01
Oh yeah, I'm gonna summarize it. Oh,

Unknown 1:08:05
oh my god. She has a Patreon and then this YouTuber, this YouTuber called wine uploaded a video titled I spend $2,500 on this person's patriot.

Unknown 1:08:15
Every Sony out of your mouth is viral marketing for her.

Unknown 1:08:19
Yeah, that's how this works. This is how this is what we have to do.

Unknown 1:08:30
$5 to listen to three people.

Unknown 1:08:32
To the one more time I'm gonna be angry. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay.

Unknown 1:08:38
This week's challenge comes from Berlin and he requested that we watch season six season six Episode One of Blue's Clues a people might be what is this Berlin?

Unknown 1:08:51
What are you talking about? Oh my god. My cue was little this show came out before my kid was born.

Unknown 1:08:58
On this side. Fuck

Unknown 1:09:00
we talking about?

Unknown 1:09:02
We're talking? Nope, nope. Different Casey. Casey say, sorry. No, I'm sorry. Mark Graham Hill. If you're listening to this, you're

Unknown 1:09:10
setting picture.

Unknown 1:09:13
It's a tree. It's a I'll send it it looks. It's a haunted tree that says don't poop on me. And it's very upsetting. Okay, I'm sorry. glues is a children's TV program that started in 1995 I believe. And it involves a little puppy named blue and all of her anthropomorphic

Unknown 1:09:35
what him No, no,

Unknown 1:09:38
dogs everyone all dogs are boys.

Unknown 1:09:39
Oh, that's true it all dogs are boys and all cats are good. But it's also it's blue. So

Unknown 1:09:44
a girl named blue? I don't think so.

Unknown 1:09:46
Okay, not, but like not fucking around here. They use so few pronouns on that show. Like a couple of years ago, there was this mass reckoning of Holy fuck blue is a and then we all realize no and her friend magenta, like blue. It was a secret lesbian all along.

Unknown 1:10:09
Everybody. That's your old pal Merlin. My daughter used to watch a show called Blue's Clues. And I thought it was as kids could shows go, I thought was pretty good. The first host was a guy named Steve, who has a very interesting bio. I'm recommend checking out Steve and his music and his backstory. There's good interview with him on I believe sound of young America where he talks about his years on Blue's Clues. And he's really cool guy. Anyway. The point is that Yeah, as Alex said, it's show for very little kids. And it's in that I would put it in that genre that racking of kids shows that are about like interactivity, usually kind of pre literal kids, where there's a lot of talking to the kid and the kid talks back, when I say it's like Dora the Explorer, it's so much better than Dora the Explorer, but is about kids yelling back and pointing things out and finding things.

Unknown 1:10:53
But there's a huge difference. So instead of like just silence, eventually an off screen kid will be there it is. So there's not this.

Unknown 1:11:03
Hurry, hurry and swipe over and staring at the screen. Oh my god. So anyway, I think it's a really good show and a really cute show. And so it had several seasons with Steve. And then Steve went to college and got replaced by Joe and it was a really sweet, sad episode, what I'm trying to tell you is that I watched a lot of really, really shitty Kids TV looking at UKU. And this is a really good show. And I really enjoyed it. And then something weird happened. We got we'd watched like, I don't know if we jumped around. But somehow this was in the TiVo days still. But we got up to the point of this episode that we watched for this challenge, which is, as you say, as 61 legend of the blue puppy. Oh my god. And I'll throw it to Alex here. But all I'm going to say is at the beginning of season six, I guess they decided to change a few things. And so and so this episode, the reason I brought it to you folks today is that I still think about I think about this episode breath. Think about how confused and upset this episode made me. And I wanted you guys to have that.

Unknown 1:12:11
I feel like you made this challenge for me because I was right on the age where I watched the beginning of Blue's Clues. But eventually you're like, this is stupid. I know where the map is.

Unknown 1:12:25
Wrong show.

Unknown 1:12:28
Like Yes, like the end, but each show has a very like nice rhythmic pace, like Dora portion.

Unknown 1:12:35
Yeah, and the characters are adorable. You got a little salt and pepper in the mailbox. And it's it really is when I say it's cute. It's not a coin way. It's adorable. And the way the blue talks is is is really really cute, too.

Unknown 1:12:47
Yeah. And the whole premise is like, all of this problem solving is done by Blue's Clues, which are these cute little pop prints. And like you and Steve are like little detectives and you figure the best way to make chicken soup if you're sick or like how to tie a shoe. It's adorable.

Unknown 1:13:04
It's like just being a part of it is just as basic little like what do you say? Like, like logic or like putting facts together something but like, yeah, you work together and it's got all the good stuff for like a pre literate kid. So cute. So you want you did watch it when you were little?

Unknown 1:13:18
Uh, but like, I don't know if I would have watched because I was five when it came out. And I feel like that's when you're slowly aging out of it should I had for right at the time I had three younger siblings who were super into it, so it's not like you said it wasn't like I was had to watch you.

Unknown 1:13:36
Watch this. It's not like Barney. It's not like Teletubbies. I mean, tell me tell me he's kind of cute. But it's it's not the kind of thing that makes you want to like tear your eyes out like Dora or Barney it actually is kind of fun and sweet in the music's nice and yeah, and it's a really cute show. And we should mention here that a lot of what's accomplished on the show Steve or Joe is live action most of what you see is cartoony and then done with what appears to be cutouts so I blue salt pepper all those kind of look like little cutouts

Unknown 1:14:02
there. Imagine the South Park and honestly that's what it is exactly.

Unknown 1:14:07
Terrance and Phillip you

Unknown 1:14:13
and Mr. Salt and Mrs. Pepper won't get out of my head. They have a child paprika

Unknown 1:14:27
little franchise so it's very cute. The important thing to know here is the show is good it's very sweet adore was done with 2d I don't know it's actual cut out but it's it's it's important to this episode to know that if you ever seen Blue's Clues you go and you see the cute little blue dog with the blue ears

Unknown 1:14:43
and most importantly most importantly almost everybody in this world can talk except blue and her other like the puppy friends like they don't talk like that.

Unknown 1:14:54
Repeat the cadence and like melody yeah person just said like

Unknown 1:15:00
like blue sky do we can do

Unknown 1:15:07
the show seemed fine in that format. But I get excited to make some food you

Unknown 1:15:12
want to tell max about what happens in this episode. Alex. All right, so the episode first of all the episode starts at night, which kind of I don't really remember like exactly the format

Unknown 1:15:24
is Blue's Clues different from episode to episode or is it basically the same thing over and over? Got it?

Unknown 1:15:30
There is a rhythm it's the same

Unknown 1:15:32
thing. It's it's one of those formula kids shows that like kids love that kind of like regularity of knowing what comes next and like even Dora it's fun to yell, swipe or no swiping. Like when you see swipe or show up everybody else swipe or no swiping. It's part of the the fun. Well, the same way I get excited when Justin goes down. Because I know what's coming. And I do it with him. And I mix you know I mean, it's anybody likes that regularity and fun. You know? Yep. Yep. So yeah, it's the same show. Basically,

Unknown 1:15:55
it's the same show. But this and it starts every show, typically you'd start and you just go into the house and they'd be blown away at that. But this episode starts at night and blue and Joe and all of the characters you know and love are sitting and looking at the moon. And Joe's like, oh, I've never seen a moon that looks like that before and all of your characters are looking at the moon. And a fairy comes down from the moon. And I know we've talked about how this is a fantastical show. Never has there been a fucking fairy that comes down from the

Unknown 1:16:30
sky. It sounds like it's talking through a fan

Unknown 1:16:34
image Do you like hi? I am alone? Or Oh no, I'm sorry. Your name is not it's it's Muna and for both Maddie and at the same time, we're like why isn't it Lou? Like

Unknown 1:16:49
oh, she's just theory.

Unknown 1:16:53
South Park character

Unknown 1:16:55
It doesn't mean she's voice it was it was Yes, yes. If you're picking the animation of South Park and now imagine Mr. Hankey, but like, I I don't know how to explain like the feeling that you? I'm trying to think of a show. It's like if Roderick suddenly went on the bin bam. Like, you know that it's like they're part of the same universe is not that weird, but it's like what what's going to start what is happening right now. Right,

Unknown 1:17:24
right. Yes, yes. Yes. It's

Unknown 1:17:26
just it's just like a little uncanny.

Unknown 1:17:29
So it's immediately there's several things shy fast track this because I guess we're running a little bit long. Yeah, so basically, so the show is starts out immediately. The songs are different things are different. It's not the usual rhythm. It's weird, right? It's like okay, something's different. Like Is this a special like it's weird because like part of it is when you're the show comes on like, and you see blue pops up on the screen and this everyone's always done in this same like, comforting way. So that's not the case. It's nighttime. What's going on? There's a fairy. Okay, so I had to look through my fingers at the screen to watch a lot of this so I'm probably gonna get some of this wrong but the I guess at some point, the fairy has come along

Unknown 1:18:03
well, hold on your the fairy tale first tells a story about how Oh, when blue was born, that she was special, unlike the rest of the puppies, because all the puppies did more normal puppy shit and she was like, sat up and read and likes to go on adventures. And she was born with a key she was born with a special key literally born with a literal key and they go and find a

Unknown 1:18:30
key so literal literal key she needs to find the lock for key Yes.

Unknown 1:18:34
And so they do this is the part that like I was like, Okay, I remember this they sing a song they check in it's like, is this the key? No. And they find the key and her stuffed animal and I don't remember her little puppy stuffed toy. And then is it a box under her bed?

Unknown 1:18:51
We tried like three different things. There's a whole like then at this point, it's a little bit Blue's Clues like you know, the sofa suddenly has a lock on it. We don't know why. sofa what I noticed is doesn't sound that crazy. But for like you watched like five seasons of this show. And then suddenly, the couch has a lock on and you're like what is like so then it becomes this really weird Freudian journey of finding finding the lock that your key fits.

Unknown 1:19:19
And oh, this one is too narrow. Kafka esque it was Yeah, it was like I was watching blue slowly turn into a very strange

Unknown 1:19:31
keeps going it keeps going like this and you're like what is it gonna go back?

Unknown 1:19:36
But But then I put at that point I thought okay, I'm just miss remembering the show. Like I miss remembering how like cute and fun it was right? But then they find the box under blues blues bed and the an anthropomorphic key. Or not anthropomorphic? Yes. Yes. The key toxin things whatever.

Unknown 1:19:54
It's a talking it's a talking key.

Unknown 1:19:56
And the key goes in the lock and bam, they they all jump into this magical

Unknown 1:20:03
hour in blues room. blues, later referred to

Unknown 1:20:07
Yes. And normally this isn't huge because they jump into like paintings and shit all the time. But But this time, the animation gone they're all fucking puppet.

Unknown 1:20:19
They're all puppets including blues and

Unknown 1:20:23
some there there are so many so many puppets you've never seen before.

Unknown 1:20:26
There's so

Unknown 1:20:28
there's every God and the fact that they're all puppets is so fucking disorienting there's this really sweet I have to say this is this part always makes me cry. This is very sweet moment when blue first talks Oh because by the way do we mentioned blue can now talk

Unknown 1:20:43
but this is this is no no but first but first okay Mona Mona goes around everybody else can talk in this universe moon goes around saying this is that your dress up place? This is this is like your new dinosaur friend. And then she's like blue. Your greatest gift evolved. And then blue. Go. She goes blue. You can talk and blue is like I I can talk and she's speaking like complete normal English. There's no proper she starts talking to you. And I this is when I texted you because I I don't know. I lost my shit. I don't know why I lost my shit.

Unknown 1:21:22
You know like that scene in the movie theater when looking at you like says the wrong it's like it's it's got loving. What are you what are you doing?

Unknown 1:21:30
It was so it

Unknown 1:21:32
would be like if like Darth Vader suddenly turned into a Ficus he just how does it have anything to do with anything? That's so cute because because hey, you and it's really sweet because she's talking to the little kids and it's so sweet. That's the single moment and that pretty much this whole thing where I was like oh my god that's so sweet. And it makes me want to cry. Because wouldn't be great to be able to suddenly talk flawlessly. It's a fantasy world But no, no, no, no, no no, that moment is steamrolled just you're not even over the fact the blue has something called blues room that's part of her special gift and found that she was born not the key that fits in the walk but the lock that fits with the key and now that's blues room and blue can talk and she's a fucking puppet because guess what you don't really have too much time to sit with that because we have so many new characters to introduce

Unknown 1:22:24
the show that this stuff is it like this is the show now

Unknown 1:22:27
it's a reboot basically reboot it it doesn't say at the beginning warn your kid

Unknown 1:22:33
but then they kept all this stuff so blue talks after this Yeah, I think so.

Unknown 1:22:37
It Yeah, I went in was like Okay, so is this like a thing and yeah, so it was kind of like now blues room is a part of the actual show and then it kind of got a spin off. But it's during the regular episode. So you go around meeting these new puppet characters who are very in a

Unknown 1:22:56
dark room. Okay,

Unknown 1:22:58
especially moving on a special gift she was given at birth with her

Unknown 1:23:04
Yeah, the moon moon

Unknown 1:23:07
so we're introduced to I got a list here on wikia

Unknown 1:23:11
we are in their house for their dog. Okay,

Unknown 1:23:14
well I know a lot of people have this for the cats.

Unknown 1:23:18
Mi ke me Boogie Woogie doodle board worse source dress up chest silly seas or Frederica handy dandy journal. Yeah.

Unknown 1:23:30
Classic character gamer bathwater

Unknown 1:23:35
you're still looking at that. Anyway, I'm sorry this is not good visually, but I'll fuck me up and it but it was also was just so ham fisted. Because once you've gotten over like you're not even over that you're still like what the fuck? Buddha talking puppet now what is happening with this show? And then they just, they're just bringing items up that are puppets who can talk and kind of be the case for your pencil.

Unknown 1:24:00
FEI windowpane

Unknown 1:24:10
How

Unknown 1:24:14
are you talking?

Unknown 1:24:14
Why are you talking?

Unknown 1:24:20
For some reason I've accepted that Mr. Salt and Mrs. Pepper can talk and reproduce. Oh yes, absolutely. But I have accepted that chicory is is a clock that's alive. I have accepted all of this.

Unknown 1:24:33
But so part it's all part of the that fictive

Unknown 1:24:35
work yes and my my like I don't know like can't my head cannon when I was little was like, okay, blue can't talk because she's like a real puppy and like this, the rest of the world is like all these crazy talking inanimate object is like Beauty and the Beast or something. And then you go into the then there is a cat that late MMX would love this cat. later on in the show. There's a cat introduced name periwinkle, but he can talk HE DOES MAGIC and is great at it. And I'm like, okay, whatever. He does magic tricks. But mostly wand and top hat tricks, you know, top hat like like the old fashioned Exactly. he's a he's a classically trained magician. And like a guy, Hollywood.

Unknown 1:25:21
Classic guy.

Unknown 1:25:23
But then you find

Unknown 1:25:24
out he's billiard ball manipulate, Oh, God, okay. But

Unknown 1:25:27
then once you're in Blue Room, you learn that she has been given. She has all this time been a special puppy who could talk but was like trapped in this dystopian world where she had to

Unknown 1:25:42
wear multiple times throughout the show. You have to interpret what she's saying. And you're trying so hard. That's why she has to leave clues because she can't talk. So now

Unknown 1:25:52
that's the that's the premise of cooperate. It's like look over here. And so now you

Unknown 1:25:57
go into this room and I was like, Okay, this. This is like funny and weird. But then at the end, it's like, okay, moonies, like okay, blue. You gotta leave. You gotta go out of your room. And I'm like, wait, they're making her mute. Again. They're taking this magical place away from her where she can talk to you. And then

Unknown 1:26:18
Oh, yeah, yeah, it only works in blues.

Unknown 1:26:19
Rude only works in blues room. And at the very end, blue goes, Okay, I'll see. She goes, we'll talk soon. And you know what, you're my best friend. Like this is. It's like, we know, this is the only time she's been able to verbalize it over years and years. editors. Yeah.

Unknown 1:26:39
Just for a second, come on blue. We gotta go. We gotta get out of your room. She's like, but say goodbye to the nice piece.

Unknown 1:26:47
And then it goes back to normal and you and and so at this point, I do not know that this was like a spin off of the show. I just thought this was like PB occasionally. They did have special episodes. So I just thought this was a one off. And so they take out blues ability to talk and you're the one who breaks it to Joe Joe's like, Whoa, where'd you go? What happened? And he's like, blue. And but then he's like, Wow, that's awesome. See you next time. And this

Unknown 1:27:17
cool special? Yeah. Oh, cool. All right.

Unknown 1:27:23
Mute again.

Unknown 1:27:27
20 years old.

Unknown 1:27:29
I'm so glad I'm so glad you had the context for appreciating why this was happening.

Unknown 1:27:33
I know that like people. Most people are gonna think this is a terrible episode with a terrible challenge. This and and the rest of the people who are like my age or younger are freaking the fuck out because it was so like this. She's been living in this dystopian hellscape where all of her utensils and objects can talk but she can't talk to you her best.

Unknown 1:27:56
Literally, there's literally a drawer that can
