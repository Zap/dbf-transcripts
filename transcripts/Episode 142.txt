Unknown 3:25
Okay, then I came in and they're

Unknown 3:29
off the chairs, but there were still wheels. And then the next week, the arms are off and the wheels were off and I felt like the chair was like a leper. It was just falling apart

Unknown 4:34
What Tony Tony Tell me if I know this but for our listeners, what is what is Gen Con? what's the what's the most Gen Gen Con is the is the I think it's the well it's definitely the biggest gaming convention in America but it might be the biggest gaming convention in the world. Okay, all kinds of games though. tabletop all table all it's all it's so it started as so it stands for Geneva Convention. That's what Gen Con is. And it was from it was and it used to be originally held in The Hague.

Unknown 5:00
Originally held in The Hague, and it was where it was, you know, Dungeons and Dragons was created in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. And so they would have people over every year to play Dungeons and Dragons, and it got an edge and or they just call the Geneva Convention. You come and play d&d, and it got bigger and bigger and bigger. And now it's an Indianapolis but they still call it Gen Con. And it's, it's primarily the it's like the biggest tabletop. I mean, it used to be primarily a d&d convention. But now I think it's spilled over to all role playing and all tabletop. And one thing that's cool about Gen Con, I've said this before in other podcasts and actually gotten quite a bit of trouble for it, nobody, nobody like

Unknown 5:35
I'm already in trouble. So

Unknown 5:38
a lot of gaming conventions like we also go to this one called Pax or not anymore, but we used to, that's the Penny Arcade one. That is the Penny Arcade Expo and that's a video game show for the general public. It's a fun show. I actually I enjoyed Gen Con and I think that's one that john Cusack goes to sometimes. July Syracuse circus I think he was at PAX East and I didn't see came into our like room and I in the Kickstarter.

Unknown 6:00
Cards Against Humanity room and I didn't see him like a lanky ninja. And now, so Pax kind of has the government structure of like a fascist police state, or like, you know, there's like a few key decision makers at the top and they control all of the resources, and they tell everyone what to do and where to go. And you know what? I'll say this, the trains run on time, like it, it does. It works. It's it's for the most part, it's it's a safe, well run convention. But people occasionally including cards, but up against the rules, and they're like, well, they're like, that's not what we want to do something and like, well, that's not state policy. And we're like, Well, can we appeal this decision and they're like, there's no mechanism for that. Now, Gen Con, on the other hand, is like an anarchist state. There's no law. There's no one in charge. Anyone can do any event like it's crazy. Like they bring massage chairs, that is a booth. It's amazing to me that Gen Con works at but it does and has a great energy. It has this really chaotic.

Unknown 7:00
grassroots like, everyone's they're doing their own thing and they're all colliding off each other thing. And when you get the book of events for Gen Con, you know, when you get the book of events for Pax, it's a it's a single sheet. And it's like, here's the shows. And here's the schedule. When you get the book of events for Gen Con, it's like a phone book. It's huge, because it's everything. It's like, Hey, you want to play d&d with your friends in a hotel room? Boom in the book of events? No, it's just like, that's it. It's there. Right? We're playing Battlestar Galactica Lark in a hotel conference room, great. Boom, it's in the program. That's an official event. It's just every and you just go through alphabetically and it's just everything is in there. And it it works. everyone finds their special thing cool. And they have an amazing time. It sounds like a lot of fun. It's Yeah, it has a good it's very earnest. I always wind up in line. Like I like our noodles and company behind some guy dressed as Gandalf trying to pay with a spell.

Unknown 7:49
Chip and pin you shall not pass.

Unknown 7:52
Merlin you'd find your special pants there. Oh, well, your don't Aren't you a special painter now? You got Oh yeah, I must. But I am a special painter.

Unknown 8:00
Really I'm getting I've got some kind of jack disease or like, I don't know, or like Brad Pitt thing or I'm getting worse at it. This is a whole other little sub branch or Gen Con but there's people who do tabletop miniatures and then and then them. What do you call it the scenes? Sam table scenes. Oh, a little. It could be a little dungeon or it could be a farm or could be a little landscape with a windmill and a farmhouse on it. But if they have like they have fucking light lighthouses that light up and rivers with moving water. Oh, it's like a train set but with cloaks, yes, but it's for you. It's for your little guys. And every year I go through this little area of the convention hall and there's all these companies that make these things. And I'm like, maybe if I got into this, I'd be happy.

Unknown 8:57
You got that basement, man. You could

Unknown 9:00
Do it right you were a little conductor hat you look so be so fun maybe if I started making like same table dioramas and I had like got like a medieval village and I spent $70,000 and had like a smoke machine built into it. Maybe then I'd be happy but Alex would keep changing the chairs.

Unknown 9:16
I can have people over why is this

Unknown 9:21
I can have people over to play d&d and there's get furious me like don't touch it like that. You're looking at a row. No, that's HO scale. You get a conductor campuses, GM on it. You're the general manager.

Unknown 9:33
Merlin Are you playing Dungeons and Dragons with these little creatures that you're making? You're just making the creek my little guys No, no, no, it's clearly a fun painting thing. Is this a is this is your daughter into this or is this a sort of dad are you sort of grooming her into your pain? That's a good question. It's it's another one of those it fits into that Rat King of like, nerd encouragements like going all the way back to whatever x men Pixar movies you name it, I guess Pixar movies of 45

Unknown 10:00
Popular but yeah, yeah yeah but no she she legit is super into it and we've kind of both thrown ourselves into it and like d&d itself when I was a youth I'm much more into the gear than the doing. I think you know there I'm a fake geek girl and a lot of ways were like it's not only am I not you know on that nerd higher or the geek hierarchy, you know, that won't famous geek hierarchy, brunch, a shuttle Cox graphic. I'm way far down. I'm like someone who cause plays. No, I'm someone who's a seamstress for fanfic cosplay. Like, I'm so, so far down the credibility. There's no pronoun for who I am. Like, it's so bad. You know, whenever you start a new hobby, like whether you get into your like, I should get into role playing games or for me, it's getting into magic and you sit down with people occasionally you'll sit down with someone who's like, has a lot of

Unknown 10:52
subject area knowledge. They're like an expert and they've been doing it their whole life. And they're like, and I'll always ask like, what advice did you wish you knew when you were starting out?

Unknown 11:00
Tell me Give me Tell me what I need to know to get into this hobby, or to become good at it. And everyone always says the same thing about whatever hobby which is, you know, man, it's not about the gear. It's Yeah, buy the least amount of stuff. Start start small and do it. It's like Matt Matt, how is advice for having a baby? Which is like just try to get some sleep and buy a bunch of ones. Like that's it. That's really all you need. You do not need a shop. But you know what, this is interesting to me because I got Oh, I was gonna say is whenever anyone tells me like it's not about the gear, man. It's not about you gotta be

Unknown 11:32
here for the brushes. Yes, this must be this might be the most fundamentally true Venn diagram for us that I can think of like, this is our third act of the movie, we would figure out that this is our power move is that we all love the gear. I feel like whatever it is, we're here for the gear. It could it could be it could be an insane or psycho brush and it could be a strap on, but whatever it is, we are here for the gear is what I'm trying to say. And so the

Unknown 12:00
The great part for me is like, here's the thing you realize in life, some age is that you, you kind of are how you are. So I spent all those years as a

Unknown 12:08
back when I was a productivity guru, like, first of all gearing up, and then reacting to my own gearing up by saying, hey, I've realized it for myself, you don't really need the gear if you want to write, you know, just right, you know, or whatever. And then I was done with that. Other things, but people are how they are. And how I am is I want to fucking notebook and I want that new pen that next talked about, I find it in myself constantly. And so here's where I ended up doing and I'm going, Oh,

Unknown 12:35
going to this place and we'll buy a couple of these, you get these sets of these whiz kids makes these really great little minis that I paint are like two for $5. Get a fucking dragon for $15. And then you get the starter set of paints that's 30 bucks. This point I'm in for less than 50 bucks, but then I get home and I'm like I watch a YouTube video. You can get this thing called a well, I need a wet palette. What Palin is

Unknown 13:00
Really sweet because you have this wet piece of paper on a sponge and you put a lid on it and you paint stay exactly where I'm so busy. I'm here for the gear to the extent that I spent so much more time acquire and mastering, quote unquote, the gear than I have painted. And it's exactly like d&d. Back when all I wanted to do was write things on hex paper and graph paper. And like and with writing, all I really wanted to do was like put stickers on my notebook.

Unknown 13:28
I mean, you can leave your bag by the door so you don't forget it but it has to be a cool bag.

Unknown 13:34
gotta leave the bag by the door you gotta have a bag in the door.

Unknown 13:40
Okay, so what I'm hearing is I need a bag and a door. Okay, so to get started, here's here's what you're gonna want to do you want to go to life after they had a great series recently on door backpacks. They had a whole series on the best combinations to power charge your turbo moment, but by going in and you get you get the right combination and then you put

Unknown 14:00
index card on your arm. It is so funny because it's like when we had Kevin and about Nick on the podcast, and we were talking about drawing and I

Unknown 14:07
was like, Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, but what what markers do I need? Yeah, Kevin, Kevin was like, I think the key to being an artist and learning how to illustrate is you have to walk through the world with like an attendee list. And like, see how things work? I'm like, trying to see the shapes and stuff like, do I buy? It's like, it's like Trump talking to the woman who was trying to save her family and community from ISIS. And she has to stand behind his desk while he's staring straight ahead, and she talks about her entire family being killed, and he goes with it. Now. She goes, they were killed. And they were looking at it big versus looking at very strongly, there is strongly. I feel very badly, because I'm a dumb guy. And I think adverbs sound better than adjectives. And then finally, he remembers that she has a Nobel Prize and

Unknown 14:57
he kind of perks up and he's like you did that day. Big.

Unknown 15:00
Vanilla Ice Where did they give you that for? I

Unknown 15:03
sketch it's like, fighting for the dignity of my people and she's like this totally like, you're like all your heart is going out to this woman and Trump is like so. Is there like a certain form that they need to fill out? How How does the no bed come? I'm here for you.

Unknown 15:19
Sound like the evil red immigrant?

Unknown 15:23
Got a little bit of the call bear Trump impression going? Oh, I say I don't think it's very good. Not you know, bear. The bear take on Trump the sort of

Unknown 15:35
henchmen. What is that? It's very Redfield. Evil, like like Dracula's assistant like what do you mean? When you say head? Yeah, it's like a little cold bear does a very evil Trump. But I know the Trump that really sticks with me. To me the best one is the is the more like Chapo one where he's just like, yeah, like, like, you know, where he's like always mad about Graydon Carter from Vanity Fair.

Unknown 16:00
So small well you know what it is the one I'm doing I'm not doing it well because I haven't spent a lot of time on it but it's when i when i read what he's typed with his tiny fingers drunk pumpkin man, when he when he types his words that he wants to say to the world. It's that's the voice that goes with his dumb guy confidence. This is dumb guy confidence. I am killing it. I am killing Why don't we just pop in? Let's pop in, says mother john. It's Miller time today. And so let's go see what kinds of things he realized very heavily on saying badly when he means bad, for example, right? There's lots of things were like, let's see. Oh, you know, that's tough, like, stuff like

Unknown 16:43
the lovely Elisa page. You know, that kind of stuff. That's the voice of him being so fucking stupid. So Robert Miller has now asked for his longtime never Trump a lawyer to sit beside him and help with answers. What is this all about? His lawyer represents the basement server

Unknown 17:00
guy who's got a free in the crooked Hillary case. This should not be allowed rigged witch hunt.

Unknown 17:05
What's your Trump Give me your Trump?

Unknown 17:08
I it's really bad. I just do the Felix mean to me. It's the Felix Biederman Trump is the one of my head like when I read his quotes, it's like, folks, we let the world we live is.

Unknown 17:19
Alex, do you have a Trump? No, no, he's whispering a secret to you like that. Oh, he gets very hoarse. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I didn't want to do it. I didn't want I didn't want to blow up Afghanistan. I didn't want to do that. Yeah.

Unknown 17:38
I'm looking at quotes, funny quotes from his like rat his like

Unknown 17:42
his.

Unknown 17:44
He's a Nuremberg rally that he did the other day. There's some funny

Unknown 17:49
you folks remember the last election. Donald Trump will never ever get the women. We got this tremendous number of women. Folks. We love the women.

Unknown 18:00
I listened the thing that you played I think in the after show last week. The bit of that the guys that the guy who left the show Brendan said that was that did that bit Oh, make a tremendous deal with his brain. Was that funny? Yeah, Brendan. Yeah. It's like an old episode, but I listened to that probably four times and I made my wife listen to it. And I was like, holy shit. Like, I love that show. I know. But the idea that Trumps brain he loves deals so much that his brain is always trying to make a deal with him. Fucking say milk, say milk man.

Unknown 18:36
Look away.

Unknown 19:46
It's just it's no it's like it's like it's still in a mostly solid state but conducting brutal medieval style killings. Medieval style is a little pieces, little pieces, little pieces. I mean, the

Unknown 20:55
through our friends dance Covina. We did a Time magazine cover. I wasn't

Unknown 21:00
So many times and I don't even read this thing and it says 2014 2018, right? But it says 20 here's where we go. We started 16 we go to 20. We get to 24.

Unknown 21:11
Then it says 20 830-236-4044

Unknown 21:24
we watched my son, my daughter suddenly very into the Batman movie, so we've been watching one at night and then we wrap back around. Wait the

Unknown 21:34
Really? Yeah, yeah, she really she really? I finally got her to watch The Dark Knight and she really liked it. Yes, good. So what do you think about those movies? I kind of better and worse than I remember. They have not held up as now I rewatch them like somewhat recently, and as I know, these weren't as good as my first saw. Well, the problem is the dark nights and reputation as what some people have called the greatest superhero movie of all time, just because at that time

Unknown 22:00
I think it came out the same year as Iron Man. I mean, it's, it's, it's, I think that's right. Something like that, but I mean it has that's right 2008 um it's also Christopher I've said this maybe here probably on practice, but Christopher Nolan just also has this style that feels like you're always in the middle of a montage. The way he all of his inner cutting betweens short scenes starts to feel kind of odd after a while. It's true in interstellar, it's true and this is true in the prestige is true. In in the dream movie. Wait, Christian. Interstellar, sorry, sorry. Sorry. I'm thinking of some other movie. You know, it's confusing because in a Kendricks and a lot of those Christopher Nolan, director, Alex Oh, okay. Sorry. I was I was literally gearing up to defend Christian Bale.

Unknown 22:46
Stop listening to Merle. This is a guy. Hey, Dan, how you doing? Let's go to dinner now. Yeah, sure. Is everything you're doing good sir. I said, Richard, call me down. I'd like you always did call me Donald. Always. Call me down on

Unknown 23:00
Thank you, Donald. Thank you very much. And then two minutes later Mr. President, it's been so great. I'm so glad Daniel Dale's sir alerts are finally getting some attention.

Unknown 23:11
Because I've actually seen him now he's been on I think on CNN and a couple other things because he's been doing, you know, he's he's got the unenviable job of trying to track down the truthfulness of everything that the president says which you know, gets tiresome, but that's his beat. His beat is like I try to track down whether this is accurate or not. And he does it kind of in real time for just about every public appearance and it's tiresome, right like oh, this is the 17th time that he said that Lisa struck it or you know, whatever this page did this blah blah, blah, etc, etc, etc. But you know, he has he he finally is getting credit for noting that whenever he calls it the cert his his Oh sir alert, because whenever he tells a story that involves someone calling him sir, it almost always like it didn't happen at all. big big the big miners.

Unknown 24:00
In the men were the biggest guys like from Central Casting. He comes in. And he says, sir, sure. I wanted to follow you on Twitter. I would have to follow you on Twitter and they wouldn't let me and and they had there was one there's one segment there was a 19. Sir segment there was like I think there was 19 search. We have a 19, sir.

Unknown 24:18
Oh, oh.

Unknown 24:21
He said they said Sir.

Unknown 24:24
klaxon. They wouldn't let the siren they want it. They want to be very loud. I tried to follow dead I was following the very conflicted Robert Miller is angry Democrats.

Unknown 24:47
Okay. I'll tell you what, Doc nutty tell me some things.

Unknown 24:53
Man, I watched I watched the whole rally and now I'm just reliving the rally and I just want to talk about it.

Unknown 25:00
The EPS the creepy Epstein house and is there more Epstein news I kind of I mean, there's the eyes from England on the wall. But one of my favorite details from the interview with that woman Savannah Guthrie interview with that woman is that supposedly, he has copious fake boobs, like over the faucet in the in the bathroom that he can deal with while he's bathing.

Unknown 25:23
Yeah, imagine that. Hey, can I borrow your bathroom for a minute church? I can answer yes. Mm hmm. Yep. Yep.

Unknown 25:31
He's got big Well, no, he's got like boobs that he can play with

Unknown 25:36
copious fake boobs, like like marble sculptures. Or it's a it's like steaming but with nipples basically like what's

Unknown 25:46
on the Epstein spectrum?

Unknown 25:58
Yeah, no, no, the

Unknown 26:00
More and more said he's got he's got fake nipples.

Unknown 26:04
Yeah, he's very classy. I have to tell you I hate to say it I hate to say it but he's His house is full his nipples

Unknown 26:12
What about what about Boris Johnson shaky fucking believe what the fuck is going on with our cable goes give me if I can break you know put a cape on that. Maybe it was no might have been an open to Oh right. It's doing a lot of keeps cover. My violence is a dream a day. I don't know. I mean, isn't this bad? isn't as bad for lots of reasons. Yes, it's very near Brexit I think. Well, so one thing so I don't actually say I haven't followed the I've been so busy this week. I haven't like super gotten into the news. But I depending on how the election went down, they might have enough for a vote of no confidence so maybe he won't actually become Oh no, he's already Prime Minister today. Now he's in the Yeah, that's what OR thinking a vote of no confidence. I think may officially fully resigned and I believe he is officially

Unknown 27:00
Minister Well, I don't know what I'm talking about, but it seems like there should be enough conservatives who voted against him. And I feel very they fucking hate them that they could make a deal with the with labor and do a vote of no confidence. I know we've talked about this before, but I just love all the shouting that happens. And I wish we had the shouting. Like questions questions to the Prime Minister. Oh, I love Oh, man. It's and what are what are the questions to the one guy who's not? He's? He's supposed to be the neutral party. Or the neutral, man. What is it? They're talking about him? Hello, internet. So is it a similar thing? Yeah, they just shouted they just shout questions at this guy. But he does I used to watch I used to it was the only thing I would have, like, deliberately watch on c span in the 90s was questions to the Prime Minister, because it was just always so funny. And what my distinct what my distinguished colleague agree that he's a terrible cocking technica, who should I would refer the gentleman to my friend.

Unknown 28:05
Ba ba ba ba. It's so wild. So well as a terrible episode. I have two podcasts recommendation bring it to you by Friday for people to listen to. I just I just got through them recently, but they're not really new. But there was the Michael Lewis podcast called against the rules and it's about it's a it's an examination of the role of referees and umpires in America. And, and so it was it was a wonderful podcast, it was very, very short series. You can really you can really mainline the whole thing maybe seven episodes or something. So it starts off where he's like literally talking about referees, like calling calling back. It was in basketball, right? We're like the basketball rights really good way to start the show. And then and then he go and then it becomes more abstract when he talks about referees and all kinds of American life like the people who decide if paintings oil paintings are originals or not. That was an amazing episode or

Unknown 28:59
the oh my god and it goes

Unknown 29:00
shader the guy who likes settled the Asian orange case. Yes. Awesome. Oh, that was really good. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, it was a it was a wonderful podcast. I loved it and the other one is Jon Ronson, the guy who did the butterfly effect about porn hub and like internet pornography. He had a follow up podcast called the last the last days of August aims and it's about a porn star who died and it was and it was up it's really sad and I was a great podcast and I felt like it was handled with it was as good of one of these shows as i've ever heard it's the best one actually have like looking you know others these sort of exploitative like looking forward

Unknown 29:37
this was not that it was that it was like shut down kind of thing. Yeah, it was that but but amazing. Cool. Ron Johnson. It was I was I really enjoyed it. I don't know if you guys listen to butterfly effect. I also really enjoyed that podcast. Yeah, he grinds my gears, but I can see why you liked him. Oh, he I like I would never stomp on his stamp. He's the one person where I would like you could never get

Unknown 30:00
Me a number for me to satisfy you, but his stuff you don't like voice What is it? No,

Unknown 30:06
he's not he's not a snack. He's um, and yet well, not like Syracuse. But we talked about this when we read. Yeah, yeah. We read books for challenge. We read a ron johnson book, which was it? I think it was so you've been publicly shamed. No, no, it was. It was the one more hit with about Trump and, and Alex Jones. Oh, yeah, he did the shorts. The elephant in the room. I don't think he's a bad i don't i don't think he's technically in his writing style. I don't think he's a bad writer. I just don't like what he has to say. I'm always like, like his the points that he's making fall short for me. I thought that I was just too dumb to understand the points he was making. But when he started talking about things I understood, like oh, no, you're just bad. Like pea pod. Yep. Oh, no, no, let's not.

Unknown 30:57
You know what, no one who listens to the show fucking knows.

Unknown 31:00
About that article, there was a there was a fucking stupid stupid trend podcasting trend piece that was going around, and we were all dunking on it and our super secret private channels and I guarantee I mean, it was funny to us, but I really don't think anyone was the show is going to get that reference right. Oh, no, no, no, I want to popped off on this about this a little bit on back to work you did? I mean, listen, that they're like my Well, yeah, you posted that on Twitter, right? Oh, yeah. There's a thing from the slack where I was putting this will put in the show notes. That's all. It's really all that needs to be said about it. The way the way I described it on back to work if you had to get it down to a couple couple sentences out of my off the dome, I'd said it's like, the people who write articles like this are what I described as tourists who A day after they've gotten their hair braided and decided they've gone native. Like there's this kind of like temporary expertise that turns out writers bring to themselves where they go out and they talk to a few people. They don't have deep fucking catalog on this stuff. And I'm sorry to be that guy who's done this stuff for a little while, but I you know, it

Unknown 32:00
On top of which I hate, I hate when people guess my motivation. I stand by my box analogy, like I don't I mean it's

Unknown 32:08
I think people are just out of ideas, people out of ideas and they just want to feel

Unknown 32:13
I

Unknown 32:15
just said you Alex about like how people teen teens drive reckless seeing, I think about how I used to drive. And I think what I said to you and our channel was that as I get older, you know, I understand the appeal of doing things that make you feel intensely. One feel intensely. But I think especially when you're younger, maybe you're a hustling writer used to be at a blog, and now you got a byline and a headshot. And it's like, they just need to feel they're just, they're just putting their hands into a flame because they need to feel for this week, and they've got a deadline. There was a really good counterpoint video the other day and and one of her things she was talking about are their ages of reason and their ages of aesthetics. And I think it's pretty obvious if you look at the world right now that we live in an age of aesthetics. And I to me, Merlin, what you're saying is a lot of these articles are just someone who wants to feel

Unknown 33:00
Something that you that really is it. I mean, these are these articles are aesthetic, they're not reasonable. They do not hold up to the slightest bit of scrutiny, but they just want to be seen a certain way. They want to look a certain way to thinking how I come across, how will this come across? It's all about image. What will people think of this? What are the optics? You and You know, and feeling a certain way as part of that not even not even getting into the clickbait nature of this, although that is certainly related. And the other thing is, it's it's sort of like what this call about the

Unknown 33:29
shoot, what's the name for this? The

Unknown 33:32
the replication crisis? In turns out science where it's increasingly difficult there, I guess I don't think this is a new problem. I think it's a newly discovered serious problem, not just a recent things, but there's something I guess there is a lot of effort to replicate people's research, right? And if something gets published if it survived the file drawer effect, what's the file drawer effect? file drawer effect is where you did five experiments and four of them prove something really boring. And so you put those away and you publish the one that deal four of them did Oh, right.

Unknown 34:00
Didn't work or or they didn't produce the result that you want it. Right. Right. So yeah, so in any case, like what gets published is like, hey, turns out and then that gets reported by the university and a press release and it goes, Hey, turns out and then and then a turns out writer goes Whoa, turns out and pretty senior on hidden brain Yea, it but so like when that there's that that's a whole racket and we know that but it's so fascinating to me. And this again gets back to Johnny and not us and the work that he's done at Stanford, which is so fucking interesting. Which is like just how how riddled with errors. So many scientific results are but then on top of it, even stuff that like we consider like, as much as science can consider something nearly canonical in terms of like that we're pretty sure this is a thing, how difficult it is to replicate. You know what I'm saying? But like, that's not, I mean, that's such a fucking goulash of like, Oh my god, like what does that really mean for what we think we know like, like, epistemologically about the world, holy shit, but you're not

Unknown 35:00
Going to get an article on Jay random used to be a blog site, if it's just about oh yeah, you know, here's here's just a thing. It's gotta be, you gotta feel there's got to be a finger in the flame about it that's going to get people mad or get people yelling. I'm here I'm here to tell you man just writing about max back in the day you would get so much fucking traffic from people who were gay bones from now and people who hated max you would get just as much screaming from both sides wait what what not max now max

Unknown 35:33
if I missed some no

Unknown 35:40
wrong

Unknown 35:43
okay

Unknown 35:56
I think people know you're you're totally right. I think a lot of stuff also. I mean, we

Unknown 36:00
So I think we I think part of it is like we live in this age of aesthetics, but also it's driven by by business case for like publications and everything needs to be shared and if you think of like what the stuff that's going to get shared as the things that make be like you said they make people feel very intensely but it's it's there's there's emotions, think of the emotions that you feel that people feel when they share things and it tends to be either all like they're like amazed by something and like, I have to share the how I feel with other people. The two kinds of screaming right? Yes, it's either all my god

Unknown 36:30
it's either all or anger. That is like and if he if you feel good and mad, you're like, I have to get everyone else mad about the visor goes down.

Unknown 36:40
You grab your spear and you go into battle. Yeah, yeah, you're like one of the avatars of those games that are always in the top 10 games, you know, the screaming face King.

Unknown 36:50
I love like kings. But you know what I mean? Like there's something about the special but the feeling of anger or the feeling of like all, where you're just like, oh my god, everyone has to know

Unknown 37:00
high fuel right now those those articles are fuel you're what you're describing is those articles are fuel that keep that fire stoked, so you can keep feeling something in your finger for a minute. There. They're high arousal emotions, you know, when you're feeling or when you feel mad, like high glycemic index content. Yes. Like, you don't just feel a little mad. You go from zero to 60. You know, we're talking about a voter worked plaques. I mean, it worked with him when I saw that Logan Paul.

Unknown 37:26
Even like, I was mad, like, Whoa, I

Unknown 37:31
tweeted it. I was

Unknown 37:33
hovering I know, ya know, and then I was thinking, you know, he went on the news and did this so that I would hit retweet. Yeah, like I'm part of the plan. If I do this, do you think it's a bit? I think it's it's like Kanye. It's like half a bit. Did he have too much do you have too much coffee? Like what what was what was wrong? it's it's it's like it's like Kanye or Trump. I think this is a guy who has an incredible instinct. It's not always it's not part of his he's not playing three dimension.

Unknown 38:00
Poor dimensional chest. But I think he has an incredible instinct for attention. And he just sort of impulsively does these things. And he's just wired this way and he knows if I act this way Oh, I see what you're saying I know this will get a reaction. It's not a strategy. It's almost it's almost like a like a shark. Sharks are like a pure like killing machine. Like they're not they're not they're not sitting around thinking about the ramifications of like, don't you think Trump is 100% on? He's not a brilliant? Yes, he's not. He doesn't like the Joker. He's like you. He's like you folks.

Unknown 38:33
Know how I got these jobs.

Unknown 38:38
My father wasn't drinking.

Unknown 38:57
He's he I don't think he's thinking

Unknown 39:00
I had no instinctual I think he's a shark. He's a fucking dead I black that is sharp operating on instinct. He doesn't say Should I swim today? He just keeps moving and eating his back gets into the corner, and something is going wrong for him. And he knows I better say, I better say send her back to her country. And that's going to get everyone how good and bad do you think actually processes? I'm not trying to be contradictory? No, no, I think it's pre thought. I don't think I don't think he processes it on that level. I think he just happens to be saying exactly the kind of thing it happens to be exactly the thing. He's programmed the same way as the people who think he's a savior who's like, he's like the golden God. He doesn't need to think about it. I mean, it's like, you know, if you're really into eating shit, you can date anybody. All you're really just there for the shit. I think Obama was a tactician, so he would sure bomber would have some legislative hurdle. And he'd retire in the evening to his to the living quarters in the White House and he would sit there and eat his seven almonds and he would sit there

Unknown 40:00
Are the notebook and he would write his speeches in longhand. And he would think, and he'd go, how am I getting myself out of this? And he'd be a strategist and he'd be calling people. And he'd be thinking through it. You think Trump's doing that? No, no, it's completely instinctual. But I think he does. I think Trump is incredibly gifted for sort of knowing. I think he just has this instinctual power instinct, and he just knows sort of where to put pressure and how to it's a kind of like way to dominate people to control so that they're always thinking about you. And they're always mad about the next thing, and he just knows how to keep it rolling. I don't think it's I think you're still giving him I don't say too much credit. But I think you're I think what we're missing in this what can be missed in this life, put it that way, is the extent to which he and the people who love him think the same way. And if you think the same way, think about when you're a kid, right? Think about if you're if you're lucky enough to have a handful of weird friends. What do you have, you have the same in jokes. You when you have the same fart jokes, you have the same homophobic jokes like whatever

Unknown 41:00
It is maybe it's the same car jokes or Beatles jokes, I don't know. But if you're in a group with 234 friends, you don't have to, you don't have to think before you, you fart and then like, like fart on your hand and stick it in their face. You know, that's going to be funny. I think there's more going on there, then then there's more to unpack there. Because I would say that the people who support Trump in this country, I don't think it's a really I think there's some semiotics happening. I don't think they really are supporting Trump. I think that it means something. Does that make sense? Oh, yeah. No, that's what people are saying. It's that it's waving in the trumpets Trump is not the thing that that's the thing that's the centrist don't understand is there is no no normal to go back to the Trump ism is what he just represents for now. Let me let me put it this way, like like, because I can relate to this a little bit in the in the sense of that, like the election where today, I would vote for Bernie Sanders that that's how I would personally vote in the Illinois primary. And for me, it's not I actually

Unknown 42:00
Don't love Bernie like, I don't feel this cult of personality around the guy like I don't agree with him on everything he says he does. But to me, it means something to support Bernie, it's like it means something broader in the culture, like Bernie becomes this vessel for the kind of change that I want to see in the country. You know, it means more, he becomes an envelope for the things that you want. Correct. Like, I'm not out here, like, part of the Bernie Sanders revolution wearing a T shirt, but like, it's the way forward for the things that I want in the world. Like I see the path goes through Bernie for the things that I want. And so it's like a vote for that guy. It's pragmatic. I think there is an element for a lot of the Trump people like I think they're, I mean, I know actually from Poland that they are sort of repulsed by the guy.

Unknown 42:44
They don't love him and they don't they don't have hold them in high esteem. But I think it's more pragmatic. It's like, Oh, well, to get from A to B. It runs through Trump. Yeah, but whether it's like Tom Green, South Park, you think about those that kind of entertainment. For example, if you if you said

Unknown 43:00
Somebody even when you were a kid if you're imagine you were kids when when that stuff was popular that kind of like or you know Johnny Knoxville and that kind of stuff if you ask anybody it's it's it's it's like first it's like Thinking Fast and Slow all over again where if you slow think and you say to somebody oh you know Don't you think that that's kind of where I'll and pretty stupid oh yeah it is it's really stupid well that's not gonna stop you from being super into it's white it's white poor I'll Did I say it wrong stupid PUE le I'm having a stroke Oh how I have never heard that's out whoa I don't either I would I my head I would say pure okay so let's say let's say you're pure L and you like your pure L and you like

Unknown 43:42
cut it all out cut it all out I'm sorry I'm sorry did the show

Unknown 43:46
the okay so so South Park you know what right right so in an email at a hot dogs ladies on Twitter. No, it looks like it's pure LU really pure, pure, pure all here. It's

Unknown 45:00
Let's check here let's check out a more times things are going Did you see my fake drill tweet? I had a fake drill tweet that was I was just going to bring that up Will you please read I couldn't get I couldn't get the misspellings quite right and I didn't want people to know what to put out on a hat so I just went with straight content All right, I can't read it until voice you gotta do I'm not gonna

Unknown 45:21
make any sense please. stomping around on stomping around the garage screaming it's more time now the boys through a cans of food at my deck.

Unknown 45:32
I love the boys.

Unknown 45:36
Little left

Unknown 45:39
with the boys.

Unknown 45:51
Let me ask you this. What sort of DMD stuff what sort of accoutrement Do you want to Alex nice to bring you back from Gen Con. Um, you know, if you're, if you're asking

Unknown 46:00
I mean I actually give you a budget No, we'll take it I will take out our petty cash so okay so I mean I had shown her my I'm not gonna say my original CSR at ND books because I've repurchased you know used ones she'd seen those but the new eight not add whatever is five worthy I'm sorry we're the ones that you had the original ones were they the ones with Gary guy, not the original original ones I did have the original original box set but I had a d&d like basically early the stuff that Yeah, the early 80s stuff was always demons on the cover. Yeah, we're not talking about the ones where Gary Gygax did the drawings himself and pencil No, no with the little booklets now though, I did have a release box out of those in the 80s But no, basically I she's loving the new books are so much nicer. There's so edition as fifth edition is good. They fixed all of my problems with you the and it's in It's gorgeous. And so really visual things especially things with Dragons. If you see cool dragon stuff, or cool elf stuff, anything with a trowel would be awesome. I don't

Unknown 47:00
how this is going to be received by you. But this very controversial, but if you actually wanted to move into the realm of playing DB or playing let me say it's playing a role playing game. I actually don't think d&d is the is the best thing. I'll say more about that. d&d is a classic. There's a lot I mean, it's it's important historically, fifth edition has a really good release of d&d, but the How do I put it the mechanics technology of role playing is so more advanced than what d&d has to offer. There's so much more cool shit out there that you can do with dice and there's better systems, better stories, better storytelling technology, it's not as boring and it's not as boring yet DMD has a lot of I'll say it

Unknown 47:42
end as well. What do you what do you what do you what do you recommend or like So? So I think, so I really there's a designer that I really liked, named Luke crane, and he's a he works at Kickstarter, and he's a friend of ours, but Luke has made a bunch of indie RPG is the most recent one is called torch bearer, and his thing is that he is a

Unknown 48:00
Sort of philosophy about role playing that it should all be about your character and telling the story of your character. Interesting every everything you do is about your character your characters relationships a good a good dm knows that but a bad team just went to try to kill your dudes in that case and you see that on something like the adventure zone where obviously it's going to be very much about the characters. I love that approach. Right. So So torchbearer is a system so you're not fighting the system to tell a story about your character the system is like supporting a story about your character. Yeah, um, there's also the one that I was actually going to keep Baker did Were you

Unknown 48:37
a limit? No, no, no, yeah, that's an RPG. I was actually gonna recommend recommend mouse guard the role playing.

Unknown 48:48
I was like, who made that and it is Luke crane. Oh, no, he Luke was a contributor he designed by Luke crane. Okay, fine. Yeah, I don't I don't know. It says guard cool. Mouse guard is phenomenal. So So

Unknown 49:01
So there's other ones the one of the ones that I was really impressed by is so the premise of I'm going to get the name of in a second but the promo it's called Phoenix dawn command. So the

Unknown 49:11
it was so we shipped it, it was so good. Yeah. So the premise of it is, you have this, your, your identity, God's sort of a character and you protect the realm and when you die and you're meant to die in your life, you're going to die like I think seven times, and every time you die, that's how you love love. Oh, wow. When you come back, you become more powerful. But the way that you die affects your skill tree. So like if you die like heroically sacrificing yourself to protect others, then you get Paladin points and die like a Hindu fan of suiciding yourself. It's so so cool. It's a it's an awesome world. The character creation is really fun like you you you have to start with a tragic backstory like really fucking fun and then the other one that I would recommend and that's, you can play it as a one shot like it's not that is that

Unknown 50:00
So and the reason I like that too is it's not like kid focused. But a lot of times there's this pressure of, you know, you're good. You're sad when your character dies, but this is the It feels like the opposite to me. So, so Okay, so then there's another game designer. I really like Rodney Thompson. He was actually one of the primary designers on d&d fifth edition. And after he worked on the fifth edition, he came out with his own indie role playing game called dusk city outlaws. And the premise of this is it it's set in a

Unknown 50:29
almost like a steampunk Renaissance, Venice or flawless. And so there's these wealthy families that are like politically important in their feuding, and you're a thief, and you plot heists to like steal art and jewels, but everything has sort of steampunk and steampunk magic, very cool world. There's a lot of like jumping from rooftop to rooftop and get you know, whatever like we want of having the steam in the campaign I played. We had to steal this like safe for a client out of out of their rival like Lord's house.

Unknown 51:00
We had we like lowered it and in the night into like a canal into a gondola disguised it and like brought it up the river and evaded the guards. But what's cool is sometimes Gameplay wise, you get backed into a corner, right? So we have the safe on the gondola and a guard boards the gondola and he's about to pull the cover off of the thing and there's a mechanic in this game where you go right before he's but he has his hands on the cloth. He's about to pull it off. And you go, stop, pause, and you go flashback. And now you get to make it you have a certain number of these. Oh, wow, oceans and Ocean's 11 style flashback and you go yesterday before the gondola was here's here's the part of the story you didn't know. It was actually about getting these diamonds. Exactly. I got I hired an A team of archers to hide

Unknown 51:46
there and they're secretly in place. And when he steps this way, he trips the trip wire and it fires a flyer and alerts them and they shoot him to and they silently kill him. So you get a certain number of those, but it's like very narratively, you feel so clever. You're like yeah, like fuck yeah, like I plan this. I

Unknown 52:00
That's exciting. Oh, anyway, we put these in show notes. Yes. And

Unknown 52:05
I'll add there's another one called a quiet year. That's really beautiful where you draw this map together

Unknown 52:11
by a designer named Avery McDonald know there's the indie RPG scene is so creative. It's so cool. It's so beautiful. And it's so it fixes a lot of the things that frustrate me as a player with the end of this huge startup cost of having to like learn this arcane now is there gear is a problem. Oh yeah, there's ones that are very This is what I was gonna say earlier was that I don't know I kind of avoided I knew when I was on the Joko cruise. I knew that somewhere in very, very, very, very low decks probably near an engine room or something. I knew there was a room full of people playing games and I put off going down there for a real long time. I don't know exactly why it seems like even maybe too nerdy for me. But at one point, the three of us went down down down, down to the bottom of this ship and went into this room and it was like a fucking It was like, it was like the cantina scene.

Unknown 53:00
But everybody's wearing a hat. It was there was everybody was so fucking nice and like welcoming. And like it was, I don't know, we were greeted as liberators. Like we just came into this room full of people playing what I could do games and like they were everybody was so nice and it was just it was I don't know it's just such a great environment it's like I know the the the phrase nerd or whatever has been like, you know made stupid possibly partly by people like me but there is something special about like getting to be around other people who share who share a common cause and interest in these things and like, why they're not at a singles bar is not precisely important. But let's just say that like these these there are things that you find new make friends that way and so I imagine something like Gen Con must be great for stuff like that. It's just like, it's okay to be your weird self here role playing in it in general, I think in a lot of ways is almost the bottom of the nerd totem pole. Like it's so like it's so nerdy, right? It's so volatile lopping right below

Unknown 54:00
Yeah, you're probably right. Are you making fun of my settlers of Katana? No no no no cosplay is its own thing. I'm doing that thing where I'm making like two jokes and I don't understand there's so many hats I don't understand what about Ticket to Ride that because play I could come back and be like a train

Unknown 54:26
midnight

Unknown 54:32
tonight where you will cosplay train

Unknown 54:37
schedule

Unknown 54:51
Oh Dig Dug we have a challenge

Unknown 54:55
no do we did when I

Unknown 55:00
Yeah, Alex, why don't you tell us?

Unknown 55:04
I mean, potentially from now until whenever the show ends, why don't you tell us about how good you did on the challenge with teeth? I mean, I have I have displayed in front of Max a stack of books you go and this is interesting. I'm gonna I'm gonna mute but I want to all right, all right.

Unknown 55:21
Keep going, Okay. All right. Here's what I did. The challenge this week was Alex's. And the challenge was to go back and find a book that you loved as a kid or a youth and to reread that book, and I downloaded the Kindle sample. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, it was just read a childhood book except. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Remember, because some of mine I don't. All right. I just wanted to say that I did down I downloaded the Kindle sample of the outsiders for my book I for my book, I selected David Foster Wallace, his classic novel, infinite

Unknown 56:00
Yeah, good job. Good job Merlin. What's well I downloaded the Kindle sample of the outsiders and I read almost all the first page. What did you do Max?

Unknown 56:11
I read the so I have I recently found a little lot payload online of ebooks of all of the Bruce Koval novels. Bruce Cole was like my favorite author when I was a kid and he wrote sort of sci fi YA books. And I read through I sort of sampled a bunch of them and then the ones that I got really excited about were I might have talked about this previously on the show but it was called the AI gang yeah oh yeah. We read those I we literally read those is it was a challenge to read them but it was definitely a challenge. I read them I read the whole thing.

Unknown 56:49
I'm fine. Another one. And were some of the other ones I found there was another one called goblins in the castle that I really like and then there's like the famous there was aliens ate my homework.

Unknown 57:00
When you're a kid Oh yeah, that's probably the most popular one. It teacher

Unknown 1:02:20
boy he's insufferable this. He's He's so handsome. He's so handsome. I said to my lady friend and coded language because my child was there. I said, Anthony strikes me as the kind of guy that would be appealing to a range of partners that he sees a wink I don't want to use your your made up sex words. What I would say is he's more of an otter. No, I don't think he's hairy enough. So anyway, thank you. What I was not a thing I super want to get into for the point of the story, except that his role as as Jonathan becomes the clear, clear and clear every episode the breakout star the show, Boss

Unknown 1:03:00
He is the one who is ace. I don't think he does the most work but I think he's associated with what becomes the most work. co Ramos and I say his name like he's so great. He's so handsome. He's so charismatic, but mostly he stares ponderously and types and stuff like that. But like, but like,

Unknown 1:03:17

I'm now

Unknown 1:04:00
My only note on this that is interesting is like in like, trying to get my kid into certain books that I loved as a kid I did return to some things from my youth like, there are so many books for very young children that endure for a reason. You know what I mean? Like Yeah, I mean like a good a moon, just the arts. Not that great, but it's a sweet thing. There's lots of just really great I mean, I could I could rattle off a million of these but like one is once you got a little bit older it was just pass preliterate to kind of pseudo literate was like reading encyclopedia brown together. Holy shit. Some of those don't make it's like riddle me piss some of the solutions in encyclopedia brown naked zero, fuck the one the one where the guy could not have put the baby on the car because on the hood of the car, cuz he'd been driving for four hours. Love it canonical. And there's another one that's like, wow, because because Robert had red hair, there's no way that he could have gotten out of the safe way. So quickly.
