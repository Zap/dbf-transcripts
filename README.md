# Welcome to the Do By Friday transcript archive! 
This is a collection of crowd sourced transcripts created by the fans of Do By Friday. [Join the Discord](https://discord.gg/uaAh6P)

A vast majority of these transcripts (and by that I mean the initial set of them) have not been verified for accuracy. These unverified transcripts have been created using transcription software like [otter.ai](otter.ai).

This is where you, the loyal listener, come in! You can help improve these archives. If you have created a new transcript, add it! If you've verified a transcript, add it! If you spot a mistake, change it! So, go ahead, give us your fucking words.

# Format

At the top of each file, please include the following block

```
Episode Number:
Episode Title:
Unverified or Verified by: (your name)
```

For each block of text, it should have the host or guest's name followed by the time stamp for the beginning of the line. [otter.ai](otter.ai) does this automatically. Please refer to the [Episode 74](https://github.com/Zap/dbf-transcripts/blob/master/transcripts/Episode%2074.txt) as a good example of how the file should be formatted.

# faq
> I want to help

Great! There are a few ways to help.
- Make your own transcription of an episode.
- Review the transcriptions and submit corrections.
- Submit improvements to the overall archive

The biggest help will be getting older transcripts into the archives, even if they have not been verified yet. We hope that if you have put something into the archives that you are working on verifying it.

> What transcription services are you using?

There are various services that will do this at different levels, but the one that I have found to be the best at separating out the hosts from each other and providing the most accurate results is [otter.ai](https://otter.ai/). The free version allows up to 600 minutes of transcription per month. 10 hours of audio. That's insane. Do By Friday is approximately 2 hours of audio per week with the aftershow, so a free account will cover the entire show each month. The only major feature that is missing for the free level is audio playback speed. It is limited to 1x on the free tier.

> Why are you using Github to host this?

A few reasons:
- To allow others to submit pull requests to the archives
- To allow others to correct the transcripts
- Searching the archive is built right in
- It's free
- No reliance on any one source

I understand it might not be the most easiest way for everyone to add their transcripts, but it is way better than having a Google Doc Battle Royale. 

> You left out all the **ahh**'s and **umm**'s and **rrraahhh**'s!

Some of them are in the transcripts.

> Where's the stammering? Merlin clearly talked over Max and Max clearly had words that were said and they aren't in the transcripts!

Transcription software doesn't do so well when people are talking over each other and it can be very hard to distinguish what is being said. We do the best we can, but please put in a pull request so we can make things better.

> Where's the aftershow transcripts?

At this time, the aftershow transcripts are not added to this public archive unless the hosts agree that we can post them. If we get the go-ahead, new aftershows may be subject to a delayed release. After all, you should be giving them your fucking money. 

# to-dos
- Create a episode list for people to claim episode transcripts that they would like to work on
- Make the archive a bit nicer looking
- Create standard header for the transcripts
