> I want to help

Great! There are a few ways to help.
- Make your own transcription of an episode.
- Review the transcriptions and submit corrections.
- Submit improvements to the overall archive

> What transcription services are you using?

There are various services that will do this at different levels, but the one that I have found to be the best at separating out the hosts from each other and providing the most accurate results is [otter.ai](https://otter.ai/). The free version allows up to 600 minutes of transcription per month. 10 hours of audio. That's insane. Do By Friday is approximately 2 hours of audio per week with the aftershow, so a free account will cover the entire show each month. The only major feature that is missing for the free level is audio playback speed. It is limited to 1x on the free tier.

> Why are you using Github to host this?

A few reasons:
- To allow others to submit pull requests to the archives
- To allow others to correct the transcripts
- Searching the archive is built right in
- It's free

I understand it might not be the most easiest way for everyone to add their transcripts, but it is way better than having a Google Doc Battle Royale. 

> You left out all the **ahh**'s and **umm**'s and **rrraahhh**'s!

Some of them are in the transcripts.

> Where's the stammering? Merlin clearly talked over Max and Max clearly had words that were said and that isn't in the transcripts!

Transcription software doesn't do so well when people are talking over each other and it can be very hard to distinguish what is being said. We do the best we can, but please put in a pull request so we can make things better.

> Where's the aftershow transcripts?

At this time, the aftershow transcripts are not added to this public archive unless the hosts agree that we can post them. If we get the go-ahead, new aftershows May be subject to a delayed release. After all, you should be giving them your fucking money. 

# to-dos
- Create a episode list for people to claim episode transcripts that they would like to work on
- Make the archive a bit nicer looking
- Create standard header for the transcripts
